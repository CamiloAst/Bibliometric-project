The purpose of software quality control is activities that support the achievement of desirable levels of software quality, and software testing is one such activity. In order to preserve the intent of software testing, it must be deliberated carefully, and given necessary time and due diligence, before being acted upon. In that regard, this paper adopts a human-centered approach to software testing, embraces mind mapping as a lightweight technique for early software testing-related commitments, provides elements of a theoretical basis for mind mapping, and offers a guided tour of software testing-related mind maps using practical examples relevant in academia as well as industry.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-2028-2","10.1109/CSCI58124.2022.00335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216683","abstraction;creativity;directed thinking;standard;visual literacy","Software testing;Industries;Ethics;Automation;Scientific computing;Software quality;Behavioral sciences","","","","40","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these systems overlook the important factor of playing style. In this paper, we analyze how playing style affects enjoyment in team competition games, using a mix of Sternberg's thinking style theory and individual histories in the form of statistics from previous matches to categorize League of Legend (LoL) players. Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength. We also used a neural network model to test the usefulness of playing style information in predicting match quality. It is our hope that these results will support the establishment of more efficient matchmaking systems.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2466240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182769","Matchmaking;player data mining;player modeling;player satisfaction;thinking style","Games;Correlation;Problem-solving;History;Neural networks;Predictive models;Data models","","13","","46","IEEE","10 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The visual interface, building block programming, and easy-to-use features of Scratch are suitable for teaching elementary school students, which can also better cultivate students’ analytical problem-solving skills and enhance their logical thinking. However, only a part of schools and students are currently learning this programming, and it is not popular enough yet. Moreover, if the teaching is mainly based on the teacher’s explanation, it will be boring. Therefore, there is a need to explore the teaching based on game design and combine teaching with fun, so that learning can become a more acceptable “game” for students, making the classroom atmosphere more active and improving the teaching quality of the classroom.","","978-1-6654-2498-1","10.1109/TOCS53301.2021.9688834","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688834","Scratch programming;computational thinking;theory;capabilities;issues","Computer languages;Visualization;Education;Games;Production;Software;Telecommunications","","1","","10","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The essential idea of MSA can be simplified as ""confident hypothesizing, rigorous validating"", i.e. quantitative knowledge arises from qualitative understanding. Accordingly, creative thinking as a useful and practical technique for complex problem solving, is the unity of divergent thinking and convergent thinking which appear alternatively in the whole creative process of human thinking. In this paper, a computational scheme based on MSA is applied to solve the complex problems. Firstly, group argumentation environment (GAE) as a computerized tool is used to facilitate expert divergent thinking process (meeting) on the concerned topics and form scenario or hypotheses based on qualitative MSA. Then, a quantitative evaluation model had been building to analyze the centralization of the different scenarios, which can used to measure the efficient of different argumentation scenario.","2161-9654","978-1-4244-1311-9","10.1109/WICOM.2007.1383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341158","","Problem-solving;Humans;Visualization;Cascading style sheets;Convergence;Knowledge engineering;Information processing;Production systems;Logic;Sorting","","","","13","IEEE","8 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
