Various learning tools have been developed to introduce programming concepts, and many studies have been conducted to develop tools using music to foster computational thinking that includes programming thinking. In this study, we focused on the affinity between the basic movements of the railway toy and the melodies and chord progressions, and we developed a learning tool to foster computational thinking by combining music and the railway toy. In this study, an activity using this tool was developed and subjects were asked to experience the activity. Based on the subjects' progress in the activity and their opinions in the questionnaire, the improvement of the activity is discussed.","2474-2325","979-8-3315-3161-4","10.1109/SII59315.2025.10871090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10871090","","Toy manufacturing industry;Education;System integration;Rail transportation;Programming profession","","","","12","IEEE","12 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those skills are beneficial for end-user programmers in order to model a task for being tackled with computational tools, e.g. spreadsheets, domain specific and visual languages.

However, it would be more beneficial not to consider computation only as a technique, but instead as a way of reasoning and problem solving. Under this perspective, there are inherent relationships among the knowledge, skills and attitudes that emanate from this field and those ones commonly related to Math. This paper discusses the relationship between the so-named Computational Thinking and the foundations of Math Education, based on a literature review. Three groups of skills that can be jointly developed by both areas are identified and some challenges and implications for education in Computer Sciences are discussed.","","978-1-4673-0793-2","10.1109/CLEI.2012.6427135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6427135","Computational thinking;Mathematics;didactic strategies","Mathematics;Computers;Computational modeling;Cognition;Games;Educational institutions","","15","","43","IEEE","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, few studies have examined whether CT attitudes influence CT skills. The present study examines the relationship between CT attitudes and CT skills for preservice teachers (PSTs). The Callysto CT test (CCTt) for Teachers was administered to  $n\,\,=$  105 PSTs to measure their CT attitudes and skills. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship of participants’ CT and problem-solving skills with their attitudes toward CT, technology, coding, and data. Findings revealed that CT attitudes predicted CT skills and provided the first step in exploring the validity and reliability of the CCTt instrument.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2021.3105938","CanCode Callysto(grant numbers:RES0047202); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Insight(grant numbers:RES0048110); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council under Discovery(grant numbers:RES0043209); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568871","Attitudes;computational thinking (CT);educational assessment;skills;structural equation modeling (SEM)","Mathematical models;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Encoding;Education;Instruments;Computational modeling","","6","","43","IEEE","13 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to teaching programming to future programmers, it has become more and more important to teach it alongside computational thinking to all students. We designed and implemented a programming course aimed for teacher students at our university. The goal of the course was to teach programming, computational thinking and the methods and tools used in programming education. The course was divided into two parts: first, the students were taught basic programming skills by utilizing tutorial-based learning with automatically assessed electronic exercises and play-based programming tasks. In the second part, the students utilized the acquired skills by teaching programming integrated into mathematics to children at elementary school level. The students worked really hard throughout the course, completing more than 90 % of all tasks in average. Moreover, the feedback from the tutorial sessions and the practice lessons at schools was mainly positive.","","978-953-233-095-3","10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400127","programming;computational thinking;teacher education;teacher students","Programming profession;Tutorials;Tools;Task analysis;Mathematics","","5","","22","","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These tools allow the teacher the successful delivery of the course content as well as the individual/collective monitoring of students' progress in the course. Students have access to their progress throughout the course and participate in creative and collaborative tasks. This course also serves to introduce transversely educational technologies to many students of primary and secondary education. The technological environment integrates the online teaching resources and the methodological tools of the course. The course uses Scratch 2.0 as the programming environment and Moodle as the learning platform. At present the course is being implemented in public schools in the Dominican Republic.","","978-1-5090-4596-9","10.1109/SIIE.2016.7751816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751816","Computational Thinking;Learning Technologies;Scratch;Moodle Learning Platform","Computers;Programming environments;Tutorials;Multimedia communication;Collaboration;Programming","","4","","22","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
