"Effect of Constructive 3D Virtual Simulation on Students' Creativity and Computational Thinking in Interdisciplinary Education","P. Zhou; X. Chen; Z.

A total of 98 seventh-grade students participated in an 8-week controlled experiment (with one class each week). The experimental group (N=49) used the virtual simulation platform, while the control group (N=49) created projects using traditional WPS documents. The results indicate that virtual simulation technology positively influences students' creativity and computational thinking. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in the sub-dimensions of critical thinking, algorithmic thinking, and curiosity. The findings suggest that integrating three-dimensional immersive virtual simulation can effectively enhance creativity and computational thinking in interdisciplinary teaching. The study highlights the importance of adapting teaching strategies to individual student needs, offering valuable insights for future educational practices and innovative talent development.","","979-8-3315-4088-3","10.1109/ICEIT64364.2025.10975868","National Natural Science Foundation in China(grant numbers:62277018,62237001); South China Normal University(grant numbers:ZDPY2208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10975868","Immersive Three-Dimensional Virtual Simulation;Interdisciplinary Education;Creativity;Computational Thinking","Training;Solid modeling;Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Education;Refining;Problem-solving;Creativity;Optimization","","","","18","IEEE","1 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, an increasing number of Indonesia students are turning their interest to study in Taiwan. However, Chinese education in Indonesia is fundamentally based on studies of Mainland China, therefore lacking opportunities for students to understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture. Furthermore, there is a lack of opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan. The purpose of this on-going program (2014-recent) is to enhance the understanding of game and animation design education in Taiwan, through exchanges with students in Indonesia. It aims to promote exchanges between the faculty and students at the universities with faculties, lecturers and artists in Taiwan for collaborative work, especially in game art design, game engine and animation. It sincerely hopes that students could understand profoundly Taiwan's language and culture by game and animation online tutorials, and provide opportunities for students to understand game design power and industry in Taiwan, Indonesia, and worldwide market. After a year of implementing the four points mentioned in this article, we have already observed some evident outcome. The biggest achievement comes from the workshop which has received significant responses and an increasing number of attendances from both Taiwan and Indonesia. In the near future, it hopes that we can hold a public event such as lecture, workshop and exhibition to raise awareness of and develop an affinity with Taiwanese langue and culture among the general public using the design thinking approach for computational creativity, such as co-design Taiwan language on-line course or game-based learning.","2470-6698","978-1-7281-2665-4","10.1109/TALE48000.2019.9225911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9225911","Design Thinking;Computational Creativity;International Exchanges;Game and Animation","Games;Animation;Tutorials;Computer science;Conferences;Industries","","1","","7","IEEE","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obtained results were statistically significant showing that the experimental group, comprised with the students who were trained with the Yupana improved their CT compared to the control group, in which the students kept doing their regular activities.

Although there is an increasing interest in research in teaching and learning computational thinking in recent years, an engaging, effective online learning system is yet to be built for teaching, learning, and applying computational thinking online. To this end, we have developed DATAVIEW, an online social learning system for learning computational thinking concepts and skills online. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we developed a new, effective online learning model for computational thinking based on our previous widely-applied R2D2 model. A signature characteristic of this new model is being interactive and learner-centered, thus ""i"" is carried out through the entire learning experiences, which provides teaching facilities to instructors and interactional tools among instructors and learners, 2) we implemented, validated, and refined iR2D2 in our DATAVIEW computational thinking online service, 3) We propose to use the DBR (design-based-research) approach to study the relationship between technology and teaching in the context of computational thinking, generating research results and findings applicable to online teaching in other domains as well.","","978-1-4673-7281-7","10.1109/SCC.2015.54","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7207372","computational thinking;eLearning;scientific workflow management systems;DATAVIEW","Education;Computational modeling;Computers;Algebra;Learning systems;Computational efficiency;Visualization","","3","","32","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability of computational thinking is of great significance to medical students engaging in basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment in the future. However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively. Our practice in class shows that these training methods has positive influence in improving students computational thinking.","2473-9464","978-1-6654-1468-5","10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569311","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569311","Medical students;Computational thinking;mind maps;MATLAB","Training;Flowcharts;Systematics;Computational modeling;Big Data;Tools;Software","","","","30","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
