Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development.","2166-0549","978-1-6654-2757-9","10.1109/EITT53287.2021.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9694003","computational thinking;project-based learning;scaffolding;girls","Technological innovation;Programming profession","","2","","32","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correlation analysis is used to explore the relationship between students' computational thinking skills (CTS) and their five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 219 college students completed the CT Assessment Test and the Big Five Personality Inventory. The results showed that there were statistically significant correlations between CTS and extraversion, conscientiousness, and openness, among which openness had the greatest impact on CTS, and extraversion and conscientiousness had moderate effects on CTS. These results are consistent with the conclusions of most related literatures, confirming the existence of non-cognitive influencing factors of CT. Based on these findings, this paper recommends that teachers can pay attention to the individual differences of students from the perspective of personality, and provide them with suitable education to comprehensively improve students' CTS.","","979-8-3503-0706-1","10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496968","computational thinking;personality traits;Big Five model;computational thinking evaluation","Correlation;Conferences;Computational modeling;Education;Artificial intelligence","","","","15","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking, closely related to programming, requires thinking and solving problems with different levels of abstraction and is independent of hardware devices. The early childhood education stage provides teachers with the opportunity to lay the foundations for a comprehensive quality education using innovative tools and technologies. Educational robotics in early childhood education becomes a tool that facilitates the acquisition of knowledge to children, playfully, based on the principles of interactivity, social interrelationships, collaborative work, creativity, constructivist and constructionist learning, and a student-centered didactic approach, allowing in turn that student can acquire digital competencies and develop logical and computational thinking in an underlying way. This project explores the current state of teaching and learning computational thinking and programming in early childhood education in an inclusive manner. Moreover, the lack of diversity and inequality is particularly latent in science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Therefore, this work considers this problem and presents an inclusive coeducation approach to this new literacy, eliminating gender stereotypes and extending them to people with Down syndrome and hospitalized minors.","","978-1-6654-4024-0","10.1109/SIIE53363.2021.9583648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583648","Computational thinking;programming;inclusion;digital literacy;STEM;childhood education","Computers;Education;Tools;Collaborative work;Hardware;Programming profession;Robots","","1","","24","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer science, information systems, computer engineering, informatics, software engineering-these are among the smorgasbord of choices available to college students interested in a computing career. The choices for noncomputing-oriented students who want to learn about the field are even more confounding. Indeed, the established term ""computer science"" is not well-defined or well understood, leading to further confusion for students and their parents as well as the general public. These are some factors I view as contributing to the drop in interest in the study of computer science. The student should learn the fundamental concept of computer sciences. Computing education has been too slow moving from the computing = programming model to a more general and understandable model that captures the essence of the discipline for everyone.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2009.334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280664","Education;Computational thinking;Mathematical thinking","Ubiquitous computing;Pervasive computing;Computer science;Information systems;Systems engineering and theory;Informatics;Software;Educational institutions;Engineering profession;Computer science education","","19","1","","IEEE","6 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success. These results have also implied that the assessment of Computational Thinking can be used as an early intervention tool to improve the students' retention, progression, and graduation rates in STEM related disciplines.","","978-1-4799-1829-4","10.1109/ISECon.2015.7119929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7119929","Academic performance;Computational Thinking;Prediction of performance","Education;Computational modeling;Computers;Programming;Electrical engineering;Conferences;Correlation","","20","","17","IEEE","11 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
