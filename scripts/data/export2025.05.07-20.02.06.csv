To ensure that students develop this ability it is important to use appropriate and accessible tools for everyone and educational digital games are presented as a possibility to teach CT in a fun and engaging way. The present study aims to understand the relationship between the learning of children with intellectual disabilities and the existing guidelines for the development of accessible educational digital games, to promote CT for them.

Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-0001-7","10.1109/ISEC57711.2023.10402181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10402181","Computational thinking;Elementary school;Programming education;Scratch","Computer languages;Education;Market research;Programming profession","","","","9","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It fills the gap between block-based programming and language coding. But there is little work that focuses on the Computational Thinking(CT) evaluation of BlockPy programs. In this paper, we design and implement a BlockPy Analysis Tool to assess the CT skills of BlockPy programs automatically. We use Python's built-in AST module to analyse each node in the abstract syntax tree(AST) of each BlockPy program. Then, considering the characteristics of Python language, we propose a new CT Evaluation Criteria based on Scratch Analysis Tool(SAT). Under the guidance of the CT Evaluation Criteria, we propose a detailed scoring program to analyze each node of the program and get the CT score. Experimental results show the superiority of our tool compared with other analysis tools.","2376-6506","978-1-7281-3129-0","10.1109/IWCMC48107.2020.9148514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148514","BlockPy;Computational Thinking;AST analysis;CT score assession","Tools;Python;Encoding;Syntactics;Programming;Complexity theory;Visualization","","","","13","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.","","979-8-3315-1641-3","10.1109/ICTeD62334.2024.10844653","Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10844653","Computational Thinking;Secondary Education;Project-Based Learning;Immersive Learning","Training;Leadership;Scalability;Computational modeling;Market research;Problem-solving;Sustainable development;Standards;Immersive learning;Context modeling","","","","13","IEEE","21 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Other issues raised by research concern the decontextualization of computing education from the actual lives of students which causes problems for students under represented in the fields of computing and engineering, such as female students. To tackle this problem, paper aimed to develop (STEM-Computational Thinking (CT)-Computing) scenarios related to students' actual lives and their local communities in order to help female students to develop STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) competences, when core disciplinary ideas and cross-cutting concepts are infused in the scenarios. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry teaching and learning and the engineering design thinking instruction strategy using physical computing activities. A validated questionnaire for self-efficacy and CT practices was applied before and after the intervention to female prospective engineering school teachers studying at Higher Education Institutes in Greece. Results show a strong evidence for the effectiveness (enhancement of CT efficacy of female students) by using the STEM content epistemology through activities implemented with physical computing platforms.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454003","Computational Pedagogy;STEM;Computational Thinking;Women in Engineering;Physical Computing","Conferences;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Engineering education;Robots","","9","","49","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But many controversial problems still exist, for example, whether thinking is needed to be taught, how to be taught, etc. This paper first discusses the necessity and connotation of thinking skills training, and discusses the trainability of thinking skills, then designs a course framework based on Edward de Bono's thinking training system and Tony Buzan's mind map, and chooses teaching thinking directly as an effective way to teach thinking skills. At last, we introduce the practice of the course framework in Beijing Normal University.
