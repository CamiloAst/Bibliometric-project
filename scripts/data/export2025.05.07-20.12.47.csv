The cyber security industry has disparate ways of recruiting its workforce owing to the prevailing educational system and diverse work roles in the field of cyber security. Comparison is drawn between the old and revised models of Bloom’s taxonomy to depict which model best represents the dynamic learning objectives and outcomes of cyber security education. A rubric is designed from the Dreyfus et al model of skill acquisition based on the iterations of Bloom’s taxonomy to assess cyber security competencies to achieve mastery. To bridge the skills gaps in the industry, Bloom’s taxonomy provides the impetus to align the needs of industry with educational programs [1].","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458047","cyber security;education;Bloom’s taxonomy;NIST-NICE framework;workforce","Industries;Systematics;Scientific computing;Taxonomy;Organizations;Stakeholders;Security","","5","","20","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962501","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962501","diversity;computational thinking;first year curriculum;persistence;matriculation","Trajectory;Interviews;Engineering students;Programming profession","","","","39","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level. In addition, standard didactic courses struggle to keep with the rapid pace of advancements driving the field, build the essential multidisciplinary teamwork skills, train the technical skillsets required for success, or emphasize innovation. Structured experiential learning (EL) has a long track record of success in addressing these issues and presents as a natural modality for early CPATH education. We have designed and piloted a project based EL course targeted towards undergraduates to address these limitations in CPATH education. At the core of the course experience, students work together to conceptualize, design, and implement innovative solutions to leverage CPATH towards addressing global health inequity. Here we present our design of the course, review insights from our first two years of piloting this course and share plans for course improvement drawn from these insights.Clinical relevance— CPATH is making a significant impact on the practice of pathology and is poised to play a major role in addressing global health inequities. This course is designed to prepare undergraduate and graduate students to innovate in this rapidly growing and developing field as members of multidisciplinary teams through structured project based EL. While open to students at the undergraduate and master’s level from all backgrounds, it is directed at undergraduate biomedical engineering, computer science, and pre medicine students who are interested in future careers in this field.","2694-0604","979-8-3503-7149-9","10.1109/EMBC53108.2024.10782173","Google; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10782173","experiential learning;computational pathology;histopathology image analysis;artificial intelligence;global health","Training;Pathology;Technological innovation;Target tracking;Reviews;Medical services;Teamwork;Standards;Next generation networking;Biomedical imaging","Global Health;Humans;Curriculum;Education, Medical, Undergraduate;Problem-Based Learning;Pathology;Computational Biology","","","12","IEEE","17 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3520329","Canarian Agency for Research; Innovation and Information Society of the Ministry of Universities; Science; European Social Fund Plus Integrated Operational Program of the Canary Islands; Tenerife Island Council and the General Foundation of the University of La Laguna; “Piensa ComputacionULLmente: Educational program to promote computational thinking through activities that enable its development and inclusion in the curriculum”(grant numbers:REF 23120270); LaCaixa-Cajacanarias Foundation; Computational thinking in the Canarian educational system: diagnosis and roadmap for its incorporation into the curriculum(grant numbers:2020EDU01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807249","Computational thinking;educational robotics (ER);pre-university education;programming","Robots;Three-dimensional displays;Programming;Visualization;Programming profession;Mobile applications;Education;Usability;Python;Operating systems","","","","35","CCBY","19 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.","","978-1-5386-2659-7","10.1109/IRI.2018.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424711","Technology and Engineering Management;design centering;Project management;creativity;reuse, integration","Creativity;Information systems;Tools;Project management;Navigation;Systematics;Smart cities","","4","","25","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Making a Case for Studying the Effects of Using GitHub on HBCU Students' Computational Thinking Skills","A. E.

Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620585","programming education;computing education;version control systems;GitHub","Knowledge engineering;Industries;Engineering profession;Tools;Machinery;Standards;Programming profession","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
