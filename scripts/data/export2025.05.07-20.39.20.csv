However, there is little research on knowledge management in makerspaces or how learners transfer their individual tacit knowledge in the collaborative space. In addition, the functionality of maker education to promote individualized and personalized learning still needs to be explored. This study is based on Chinese STEM graduate students’ experiences with project-based learning in a Maker Education environment to test how AIGC tools help to acquire and transfer students’ individual tacit knowledge. The sample was formed from 266 MPhil students taking the ""Design Thinking and Effective Academic Communication"" course in their first academic year at the world’s first interdisciplinary university in southern China. The AIGC teaching intervention was based on the four-phase knowledge management model. In a cycle of socialization-externalization-combination-internalization,learners first explore expertise in a research area in project teams and formulate their research interest. Then, storytelling, analogy, and metaphor data were first used to assess students’ abilities to communicate their research topic in text and images on an A4 paper. The subsequent AIGC-supported instructional intervention consisted of 20-minute instructional Sprints with two instructors from Computational Media Arts and Academic Communication over two consecutive weeks. The students’ work shows that combining AIGC tools allows for a higher quality of visualization of tacit knowledge in the combination phase -.","","979-8-3503-0233-2","10.1109/ICET59358.2023.10424137","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10424137","AIGC;tacit knowledge;knowledge management;Maker Education","Visualization;Federated learning;Education;Collaboration;Writing;Knowledge management;Videos","","2","","8","IEEE","12 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different views about this subject can lead to disagreements of classification criteria among ANN researchers. In order to contribute to this debate, two of these views are highlighted here: one is related directly to the cerebral cortex biological structure, and the other focuses the neural features and the signaling between neurons. The model proposed in this paper considers that a biologically more plausible ANN has the purpose to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities, including learning processes, of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models upon which the proposed description is based takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and inter-neuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses. Also, the duration of action potentials is taken into account. In addition to the characteristics for encoding information regarding biological plausibility present in current spiking neuron models, a distinguishable feature is emphasized here: a combination of Hebbian learning and error-driven learning.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-9637-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033387","","Neurons;Biological information theory;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks","","1","","27","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research attempts to answer the question and tries to determine what factors can affect an employee to become a chief and capable to achieve performance target. To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees. If organization wants to select potential employees to become chief and predicts them achieving their target, classification techniques should include all employees as the population and avoid to choose only subsets to ensure the confidence of result. Meanwhile, KL-Divergence function generates competencies that affect employee who become a chief and achieve the target. They are achievement orientation, adaptability, analytical thinking, communication and information seeking.","","978-1-5090-5548-7","10.1109/CyberneticsCom.2016.7892560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7892560","prediction;career management;classification;kl-divergence","Engineering profession;Predictive models;Classification algorithms;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Data models","","5","","6","IEEE","6 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A symmetric cloud and two asymmetric clouds were designed to express three qualitative concepts and the relationship between them. These three qualitative concepts represent different mildew degree including non-mildew, spot mildew and severe mildew. The mathematical property of each qualitative concept was described by a group of digital characteristics. After color features which can reflect the changes of diseased rice seeds were extracted from images, a cloud classifier was developed to classify the mildewed seeds elastically on the basis of cloud generators which implemented mapping between qualitativeness and quantities. Compared with the current rigid classifying methods, the cloud classifier was in conformity with the real distribution of data and simulated human thinking in qualitative way. An experiment was conducted to test on the classifier based on cloud and another classifier based on neural network. The results showed that the classification accuracy of cloud classifier was higher than the classification accuracy of neural network.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5364494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364494","","Clouds;Machine vision;Entropy;Educational institutions;Agriculture;Electronic mail;Humans;Neural networks;Helium;Data mining","","2","","8","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
