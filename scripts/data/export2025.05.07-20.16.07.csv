"Perspectives on engineering design learning: Realities, challenges, and recommendations","W. Akili","Principal, Geotechnical Engineering, Iowa, USA",2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"7 Dec 2015","2015","","","1","7","Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344190","Design education;design thinking;convergent & divergent thinking;project-based learning;the hybrid approach;team environment","Education;Uncertainty;Context;Data models;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","","3","","30","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"DGCC: A Case for Integration of Brain Cognition and Intelligence Computation","G. Wang","Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence, Chongqing, P. R. China",2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),"10 Feb 2019","2018","","","478","479","Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637436","brain cognition, intelligence computation, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, granular computing","Cognition;Cognitive systems;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Rough sets;Conferences","","2","","11","IEEE","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for ""innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses"" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.","2377-5408","978-1-4799-3149-1","10.1109/ASWEC.2014.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824112","computer science education;computational thinking;educational game design;end-user programming;cyberlearning;MOOC;learning analytics","Games;Software engineering;Programming profession;Education;Software;Communities","","3","","29","IEEE","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existence of software vulnerability makes the software system vulnerable to attack and affects the reliability of the software system. In this paper, the upper computer system uses the HashMap structure to store the query data directly in the structure and reduce the mapping process from data to table objects.

It is necessary to design a geological information service system to analyze and evaluate geological hazards. With the development of computer and Internet service model, it is now possible to obtain rich data and process the data with some advanced computing techniques under network environment. Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment. Specifically, some key techniques of modeling the information service system and computing geological data via CPS and IoT are discussed. Moreover, the security issue of the proposed system is also analyzed.","","978-1-4673-8637-1","10.1109/IIKI.2015.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428352","cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST);Internet of Things (IoT);geological data processing;cloud computing","Geology;Information services;Cloud computing;Aerospace electronics;Computational modeling;Computers;Real-time systems","","8","","14","IEEE","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We strongly support Wing's assertion. Accordingly, we report the results of our meta-analysis of CT curricular implementations since 2006. Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344239","education;pedagogy;computational thinking;K-12;science education;computer science","Education;Writing;Programming profession;Computers;Google","","3","","9","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
