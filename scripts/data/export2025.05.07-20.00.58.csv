Computational Thinking (CT) has been defined as an important skill as digital literacy that must be learned by next generation. Along with the need to make an agreed definition of CT many countries are still in the process of, or have not started, introducing CT into the curriculum at all levels of education. It was also found in Indonesia that Computer Science / Computing, which could be the most obvious place to teach CT, has not been the main subject in several schools. This research aim is to design an alternative CT learning media to study interestingly and effectively computational concept which consists of 4 elements, namely decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm. Research and Development followed by ADDIE development model (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation) is used to capture the problem, identify the user need to be implemented in digital media. This learning media application product is equipped with an educational game based on computational thinking. The media has several features such as presentation of material and examples of problems and the solution, and small challenges in a games consisting of 3 stages. The subjects of this study were students of K-12. The data used for analysis was collected in several ways, including observation, questionnaire, pre-test and post-test in similar question. The result is the use of CT learning media is very helpful to improve students' understanding of CT in problem solving even in different topics.","2643-6175","978-1-7281-5009-3","10.1109/ISCIT.2019.8905149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8905149","computational thinking;ICT;learning media","","","1","","14","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Physical computing is a potential solution that provides ample opportunities for creative development of such skills. The availability of pre-assembled physical computing tool kits often do not offer the right level of abstraction and flexibility to suit educator's needs. Consequently, this paper presents the design of a custom physical computing tool kit, T{h}inker, primarily for learning and teaching computational thinking and programming skills. Prior to design discussions, the context and motivation behind designing T{h}inker has been presented. Preliminary pilot deployment sessions of T{h}inker for both teachers and students confirm its potential as an effective tool for both teaching and learning of thinking skills.","2161-377X","978-1-5386-6049-2","10.1109/ICALT.2018.00075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8433520","physical computing, computational thinking, introductory programming, entry-level undergrads;constructionist learning","Tools;Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Gas detectors","","5","","9","IEEE","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, the artificial intelligence course “Challenging Tic-Tac-Toe” was conduct in senior high school. The results showed that the game-based learning in artificial intelligence courses could help students to master artificial intelligence subject knowledge, significantly improved the computational thinking practices, enhanced learning interest, motivation, self-confidence, and reduce cognitive load.

Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343475","Computational thinking;conception;topic modeling","Analytical models;Discussion forums;Computational modeling;Government;Education;Accreditation;Computer science education","","","","13","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hypothesized that it is a construct of inquiry, computational thinking, and mathematical problem solving. The hypothesis was empirically tested by administering tests to 261 high school students for assessing three inquiry skills, two dimensions of computational thinking and five mathematical problem solving skills. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a three factor model of inquiry skills and two factor model of computational thinking skills to have a good fit. Mathematical problem solving skills were characterized with a two factor model. These factors were combined in a higher-order factor model into one construct that could be defined as a complex problem solving skill.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-3485-7","10.1109/ICALT.2019.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820852","problem solving;inquiry-based learning;computational thinking;mathematical problem solving;theory building","Problem-solving;Pattern recognition","","4","","17","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, efforts involving the formal assessment of computational thinking has primarily focused on middle school grades and above; and are mostly based on the analysis of projects in specific programming environments. A Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt), aimed at early ages, and based on the Computational Thinking Test [1], has been designed including several improvements; submitted to a content validation process through expert´s judgement procedure; and administered to Primary School students.
