The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637141","European Union Horizon 2020 programme H2020-EU.5.d.(grant numbers:787476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637141","computational thinking;science fair;school education","Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Conferences;Documentation;Programming;Ecology;Pupils","","","","16","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.","","978-1-6654-6077-4","10.1109/ICITEE56407.2022.9954123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9954123","Waste Separation;Mixed Reality Technology;Environment;Computational Thinking","Waste management;Performance evaluation;Mixed reality;Games;Virtual reality;Media;Problem-solving","","2","","22","IEEE","23 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.","","978-1-5090-6595-0","10.1109/IWSC.2017.7880506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880506","","Cloning;Software;Sprites (computer);Programming profession;Parallel processing;Visualization","","31","","23","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education.","","978-1-6654-7095-7","10.1109/ICECCME55909.2022.9988046","Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:03WIR1313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9988046","Research-based Learning;E-learning;STEM Field;Computational Education;Higher Order Thinking Skills","Electronic learning;Mechatronics;Shape;Pandemics;Education;Data visualization;Communication channels","","","","21","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757720","transdisciplinary;middle school;engineering pipeline;underrepresentation;educational robotics","Art;Computational modeling;Robots;Computer science;Training;Algorithm design and analysis","","15","","25","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028486","algorithmic thinking;algorithmic expression;assessment;elementary school children","Programming profession;Tools;Education;Visualization;Computational modeling","","1","","25","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Critical Systems Thinking","M. C. Jackson","University of Hull, UK",Critical Systems Thinking: A Practitioner's Guide,"","2024","","","47","68","Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision‐makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, ‘systemic critique’, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, ‘systemic pluralism’, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, ‘systemic improvement’, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to ‘systemic pragmatism’. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>","","9781394203581","10.1002/9781394203604.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10534124.pdf&bkn=10534082&pdfType=chapter","","Systems thinking;Complexity theory;Floods;Adaptation models;Stakeholders;Observers;Computational modeling","","","","","","17 May 2024","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"
