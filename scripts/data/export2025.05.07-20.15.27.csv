The method used in this research was quantitative with a descriptive exploratory scope, with an inductive-deductive approach. The sample consisted of 28 students taken from the population of the tenth-grade students of “Santa Mariana de Jesús” high school. The technique used was the survey and the data collection instrument was a questionnaire at the beginning (Pre-Test) and at the end of the process (Post Test). A ""Rubric to evaluate computational thinking"" using the Likert scale was used for its tabulation, with the use of the STEAM instructional framework learning methodology, and a ""Checklist"" was used to monitor the progress of the project. The result of the data analysis showed positive increase in computational thinking skills, due to in the Post Test the students reached the scale Very well with 64%, taking into account that in the beginning (PreTest) it was 14%, concluding that educational robotics is a didactic strategy that promotes computational thinking.","","978-1-6654-5517-6","10.1109/ICI2ST57350.2022.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10063777","Palabras Clave – educación;pensamiento computacional;robótica educativa;innovación;creatividad","Robots;Instruments;Software;Information systems;Education;Visualization;Technological innovation","","","","","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology Against Unplugged Computational Thinking Activities","I. S. Ahmad; T. Y. Sim; C. A.

One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.","","979-8-3503-0268-4","10.1109/ICOCO59262.2023.10397736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10397736","UTAUT;computational thinking;unplugged learning","Surveys;Correlation;Computational modeling;Hybrid learning","","","","31","IEEE","24 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The role of knowledge, motivation, disposition and metacognitive style played in problem solving is also to be discussed. We interpret problem solving as a complex method in which creative and critical thinking play determinative roles.

"Measuring Cognitive Loads while Learning Computational Statistics","R. Quintero-Manes; C. Vieira; N.

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962606","Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory","Presses;Correlation;Keyboards;Cognitive load;Task analysis;Programming profession","","2","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044224","computational thinking;digital literacy;education;programming;Scratch","Educational institutions;Programming profession;Training;Games;Computers","","3","","22","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.","","978-1-6654-0460-0","10.1109/SBBS50483.2020.9314935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314935","artificial intelligence;knowledge representation;machine intelligence;machine learning;machine thinking;reasoning system;semantic computing;telehealth","Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Medical services;Intelligent agents;Software algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Games","","","","14","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
