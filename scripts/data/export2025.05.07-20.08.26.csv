"Automated Personalized Assessment of Computational Thinking MOOC Assignments","H. M. Jamil","Department of Computer Science, University of Idaho, USA",2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT),"7 Aug 2017","2017","","","261","263","One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python. The MindReader system is able to assess student assignments and guide them how to develop correct and better code in real time without human assistance.","2161-377X","978-1-5386-3870-5","10.1109/ICALT.2017.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001776","Authentic assessment;computational thinking;automated assessment;computer programming;program equivalence","Programming profession;Pattern matching;Radiation detectors;Education;Peer-to-peer computing;Semantics","","14","","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Personalized feedback can potentially improve both learning outcomes and retention for novice learners of computer programming. Online learning management and assessment systems have the power to allow self-paced, individualized and multi-layered learning that can be easily combined with time tested learning strategies such as pair programming, game based learning or visual programming to positively impact learning outcomes and support free-choice learning. In this paper, we introduce an online automated tutoring and assessment system, called MindReader, for introductory programming in C++. We discuss how MindReader generates personalized feedback fully automatically and prioritizes semantic error messages to avoid overwhelming the learner with a large number of signs of “failures.” We also discuss how MindReader can be used as a flexible teaching tool for introductory programming classes, and how its smart tutoring and assessment systems can improve learning.","2161-377X","978-1-6654-9519-6","10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853841","Novice programmer;block-text transition;learning environment;automated feedback;computational thinking","Visualization;Semantics;Education;Anxiety disorders;Switches;Games;C++ languages","","2","","14","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combination of these approaches provides a better understanding of the scenario alternatives available to decision makers. This is, recognizing the context of the focal question with creative scenario plots that show the interaction between its key drivers. Therefore, the hybrid model, should be useful to unify the strategic point of view by recognizing the most plausible scenario, while reducing the uncertainty due to ambiguous value judgments by Key Decision Makers (KDMs).The work presented in this article aims to develop hybrid model by combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to engage a new non-linear form of systems thinking about the future.

This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes. The simulation section assesses the performance of the HCDTPC, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in pattern classification.","2325-0690","979-8-3503-0747-4","10.1109/ICAMechS59878.2023.10272839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10272839","Convolutional Neural Network;Hashing Technique;Deep-Thinking Pattern Classifier;Classification","Mechatronics;Pattern classification;Clustering algorithms;Transforms;Computer architecture;Visual systems;Feature extraction","","2","","21","IEEE","10 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rubiés-Viera","Computer Science, Multimedia and Telecommunications Dpt, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), Barcelona, Spain; Engineering Associations of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain; Statistics and Operation Research Dpt, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (UPC), Barcelona, Spain; Digital Society Commission, Political Science and Sociology Association of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain",2024 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),"8 Jul 2024","2024","","","1","8","This work aims to explore the application of the physical and digital twin pair as a computational thinking instrument to support learning and exercise proportional reasoning at the ages at which pursuing STEM studies is decided. Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578918","Microworlds;Digital Twin;STEM;Computational Thinking;Proportional Reasoning","Computers;Instruments;Conferences;Toy manufacturing industry;Documentation;Cognition;Digital twins","","","","29","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
