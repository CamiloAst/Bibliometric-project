"Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking","C. Evia; M. R. Sharp; M. A. Pérez-Quiñones","Technical Communication Virginia Tech, Department of English, Blacksburg, VA; Humanities & Communication Department, Communication Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL; Virginia Tech, Department of Computer Science, Blacksburg, VA",IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,"29 Jan 2016","2015","58","3","328","343","Background: The diffusion of component content management and structured authoring workflows and technologies in technical communication requires that instructors of documentation courses determine effective ways to teach component content management to students who may initially be intimidated by authoring environments and structures, such as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393614","Abstractions;computer languages;DITA;documentation;rhetoric;standards;writing;XML","Documentation;Content management;Computer languages;XML;Rhetoric;Writing","","22","","40","IEEE","26 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation of teachers, particularly educators from less densely populated communities. This experience report shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person Exploring Computer Science (ECS) PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. Using two years of data collected from pre-and post-PD surveys and course participation observations, this experience involved 152 teachers from 34 states and Washington, DC. The findings reveal how the development of a facilitated learning community model of professional development, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers' confidence in adapting and delivering lessons that are designed to be engaging and accessible to all students. Findings also suggest that teachers highly valued the opportunity to authentically collaborate around their common computer science course with diverse instructors from all corners of the United States. As CS education expands, the instructional environment described in this report provides an exemplar for how an online professional learning community design can concurrently build the specialized content knowledge, inclusive belief systems, and pedagogical skills of CS teachers.","","978-1-7281-0821-6","10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985959","High School Computer Science;Equity;Inquiry;Online Professional Development;CS Reform;Broadening Participation in Computing;Pedagogy;Race and Ethnicity","","","4","","16","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Much of the literature in CS outreach research examines summer camps, after-school programs, and other school-year events that often have a focus on only teaching students computing content. Our program is unique and socially relevant as students are trained to assist teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-Infused curricula for their classrooms. This paper presents the design of our program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, facilitators, and the teachers assisted by the participants. We share our lessons learned in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272515","Professional Development;STEM+C;Computational Thinking","Fires;Education;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Games;Interviews;Handheld computers","","2","","12","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Critical Systems Practice 2 – Produce an Intervention Strategy","M. C. Jackson","University of Hull, UK",Critical Systems Thinking: A Practitioner's Guide,"","2024","","","113","158","Summary <p>This chapter details what is involved in Produce, the second stage of any Critical Systems Practice (CSP) intervention. Produce is concerned with the design of an appropriate intervention strategy based on the learning derived from Explore. It continues to carry forward the commitments of Critical Systems Thinking (CST) by selecting appropriate systems methodologies, models and methods that will later be used in a pluralist fashion to drive multifaceted improvement in a situation of interest. The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described – engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as ‘dominant’ at different times to steer interventions. Finally, some possible objections to what Produce suggests are discussed.</p>","","9781394203581","10.1002/9781394203604.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10534128.pdf&bkn=10534082&pdfType=chapter","","Systems thinking;Schedules;Computational modeling;Testing;System dynamics;Sustainable development;Stakeholders","","","","","","17 May 2024","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

Some of them studied different aspects aiming to identify the reasons behind the high failure rates, such as students' mathematics background and text comprehension. This study is focused on identifying which mathematical knowledge positively correlates with programming skills acquisition. We claim that mathematical concepts related to induction, inference and logical reasoning are among such knowledge. To confirm it we conducted a quasi-experiment with students who were enrolled at a first programming course (CS1). We analysed their mathematical knowledge through a test and gathered information on their difficulties and strategies used to overcome their programming difficulties. The data sample was too small to allow for strong assertions. However, the results indicates a possible correlation between mathematical abilities and programming potential. Also, students repute the logic of programming and teaching methodology as the main sources of difficulties. Furthermore, many of them prefer to ask their teachers or look at websites to tackle their difficulties.","","978-1-7281-1666-2","10.1109/EDUNINE.2019.8875849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875849","computational thinking;mathematics;programming","Programming profession;Correlation;Education;Problem-solving","","3","","21","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Acquiring these skills through traditional methods often presents challenges for students, mainly because the teaching material is presented in plain images with which students cannot interact to gain greater understanding. This paper describes the development of a computational tool designed to transform plain axonometric projection images into 3D models compatible with CAD design software. To achieve this, we have engineered deep learning models to accurately classify, locate, and identify geometric elements within axonometric images. Our experimental results highlight the enhanced performance of the Faster-RCNN model, which achieved an 81 % mean Average Precision (mAP) on test images. This tool can help engineering students to have a better learning experience, allowing them to interact with three-dimensional representations and significantly improve their spatial understanding.","2996-895X","979-8-3503-5528-4","10.1109/ANDESCON61840.2024.10755621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10755621","Computer Vision;Deep Learning;Deep neural networks;Axonometric Images;AutoCAD;Spatial Thinking","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Image synthesis;Computational modeling;Transforms;Data models;Software;Problem-solving;Engineering students","","","","18","IEEE","25 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
