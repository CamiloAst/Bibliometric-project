The project was born from an activity developed by the Educational Robotics Club, which aimed to integrate technology and education. Using Arduino robotics kits, the students applied concepts of computational thinking, digital culture, and programming to build an interactive replica of the park. The project also sought to promote the cultural heritage of Brusque, Santa Catarina, encourage creativity and innovation among students, and foster educational tourism in the city. There were some challenges, but the students persisted and completed the model. They successfully presented it at the 1st Education, Technology, Innovation, and Science Exhibition, where they won second place in the Tinkercad and Arduino categories.","2643-685X","979-8-3503-9108-4","10.1109/SBR/WRE63066.2024.10837845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837845","Interactive model;Arduino Robotics Kit;Computational Thinking;and Robotics Club","Technological innovation;Conferences;Education;Urban areas;Cultural differences;Robots;Programming profession;Creativity","","","","12","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has often been dubbed as the ""cradle-to-grave"" approach to producing reliable, cost-efficient software delivered in a timely manner that satisfies the customer's needs. It interleaves the concepts of individual work with team work and the soft skills of technical writing with technical proficiency. Therefore, as computer science educators, we are faced with the challenge of creating a learning experience for our students that effectively introduces the technical aspect of software engineering principles, as well as those essential non-technical skills. The goal of this paper is to describe a work in progress that focuses on creating an enhanced learning experience where computational thinking, collaborative learning, and service-learning are infused into an undergraduate software engineering course. The paper introduces these concepts and how each is used to train students.","","978-1-4244-3218-9","10.1109/ICSEA.2008.72","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4668124","software engineering education;computational thinking;collaborative learning;service-learning","Education;Software engineering;Computer science;Software maintenance;Production systems;Collaborative work;Writing;Hardware;Industrial training;Application software","","","","14","IEEE","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pure exploitation makes the agent reach the partial optimal solution quickly. Exploration avoids the partial optimal solution but too much exploration will reduce the performance of the Q -learning algorithm. How to avoid the partial optimal solution and find the global optimum solution is one of key goals of action selection in Q-learning. In this paper, the thinking of tabu search algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning. The optimized algorithms called T-Q-learning is proved to have a faster convergence rate and avoid the partial optimal solution in the experiments.","","978-0-7695-3311-7","10.1109/ISCID.2008.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725666","reinforcement learning;Q-learning;tabu search","Approximation algorithms;Convergence;Computational intelligence;Algorithm design and analysis;Design optimization;Computer science;Learning systems;Accelerated aging","","4","","6","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT. It has unique advantages in constructing objective and comprehensive evaluation indicators and provides an evaluation basis for the evaluation practice of CT skills.","","978-1-6654-8048-2","10.1109/ICIET55102.2022.9779003","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61977031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779003","CT concepts;spectral clustering;evaluation indicators;CT practice;CT perspective","Statistical analysis;Education;Clustering algorithms;Reflection;Computational efficiency","","1","","24","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
