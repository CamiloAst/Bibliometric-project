Block-based programming environments scaffold children to explore and learn programming in an easier way. In this paper we present a project supported by a theoretical framework that mobilizes constructionism, the maker movement, tinkering, and project-based learning, and a practical framework based on workshops with primary teachers. Primary school children developed computational thinking and creative computing skills, while they design and present ideas to turn their city a smart city. Results show the quality of the products developed using programming and robots and the impact that this approach can have in authentic learning.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970130","Computational Thinking;Creative Computing Robotic;Project-Based Learning;Primary Schools","","","1","","13","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The educational intervention MadeByKids called an external educational provider to 17 schools to conduct a series of workshops, having pupils age 7 - 12 solve challenges such as designing the schoolbag 4.0 or the future classroom. The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658859","21st century competences;digital competences;design thinking;computational thinking;school;challenge;teacher education;sustainability","Conferences;Technological innovation;Prototypes;Educational technology;Stakeholders","","5","","25","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes the development and pilot testing of an Android based serious gaming App for mobile devices called Pic2Program. The App aims to teach children the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) in a playful way. The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders. The results show that students find the App well-structured and help them to understand the basics of programming.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125087","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125087","computational thinking;solution-based thinking;education;IT-based learning;E-learning;M-Learning;Android;image recognition;young children;preschool children;cognitive development;problem solving","Image recognition;Computed tomography;Conferences;Neural networks;Games;Mobile handsets;Problem-solving","","11","","31","IEEE","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To develop overall skills for a student, it is required that a student demonstrate his knowledge, skills, and abilities in a various ways i.e., through multiple choice questions, fill the gaps, problem solving, short and long answers. Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed. This paper highlights drawbacks/difficulties with automatic short answers grading. Authors tried to discuss the scope for researchers in this field of automated grading using machine learning algorithms.

Fast Delivery facilitates the resolution of programs because it is written in a textual programming language through a simple and intuitive pseudocode in the Spanish language. The game employs a gamified approach where users answer coding questions displayed on the screen by selecting code fragments from boxes to complete the given code. Using various associated techniques, such as gamification mechanics that will be lives and scores. And also the behavioral instruction technique that will work through visual and auditory stimuli. To evaluate the effects of the game use on learning and motivation, a study was carried out with students from a Chilean educational school. The results show that some students presented an overall learning gain, while others performed worse in the posttest than in the pretest. A motivational questionnaire based in the Self-determination Theory, supports the idea that students perceived the activity as difficult, lowering their sense of autonomy and competence, raising pressure, and thus negatively affecting motivation. Results by learning objective suggest that higher learnings were obtained for decision structures rather than for cycles and arithmetic operations with variables.","2691-0632","979-8-3315-2789-1","10.1109/SCCC63879.2024.10767671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10767671","Educational software;Self Determination Theory;Game-based Learning;computational thinki","Computer science;Visualization;Video games;Computer languages;Codes;Education;Games;Encoding;Logic;Arithmetic","","","","0","IEEE","3 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This understanding and ""computational thinking"" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.","0730-3157","978-1-5386-2667-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.00175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377800","Computer science education, Computational thinking, Model-driven development","Games;Tools;Education;Unified modeling language;Computational modeling;Software","","14","","37","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
