"New methods on the way to intelligent modeling in computer integrated engineering","L. Horváth","John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics, Óbuda University, Hungary",IECON 2010 - 36th Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics Society,"23 Dec 2010","2010","","","1359","1364","Advanced engineering uses highly integrated modeling that serves product development and application for lifecycle. In the course of a group work, communication between engineers is done increasingly through complex product model. This paper analyzes this new function of product model and recognizes that current product models can not provide for its efficient support. In this context, poor representation of decision background is considered as main cause of the communication shortage. As a possible contribution to better communication, the author proposed a new information content based extension to currently prevailing product model in the form of a new sector. This paper introduces and discusses a new development in the above mentioned extension in order to establish a contextual chain of model entities from human intent, through objectives for product and contextual connections to decisions. The proposed new method is devoted to enhance current professional product modeling on the way towards human defined, company related, verified, and authorized and responsible engineer controlled intelligence of engineering modeling. Paper starts with an introduction and evaluation of the above cited information content based extension to currently prevailing product model. Following this, the proposed new contextual modeling of background of decisions on engineering objects is discussed. This modeling provides support for decision making at the application of product model and collecting experiences and methods for similar problems in the future. As the main part of the paper, new contextual content entities are proposed. Finally, some words are devoted for future plans of research in the proposed intelligent engineering method.","1553-572X","978-1-4244-5225-5","10.1109/IECON.2010.5675486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5675486","","Humans;Context modeling;Aerospace electronics;Computational modeling;Proposals;Adaptation model;Mathematical model","","9","","11","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As part of GALA, a comprehensive state of the art analysis of existing serious games for the business and industry domain (loosely defined) was undertaken. A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The ""simulation level"" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.","","978-3-943024-05-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041266","Serious Games;State of the Art;Training;Business and Industry","Games;Business;Industries;Production;Training;Computers;Computational modeling","","4","","17","","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Video-based lectures and materials are to be referred before the actual class as a pre-class activity in the flipped classroom setting and completion status are evaluated through learner's feedback. In this paper, pre-class activities are evaluated by applying process mining on the student's clickstream data generated through learning platform “Delta” designed for current work. The students are categorized as credible and mediocre performers based on their pre-assessment score and process models are generated by applying fuzzy miner and heuristic miner based on their engagement with the tool. We further analyzed and registered the absolute & relative occurrences of events, identified a contrasting pattern in student behavior through trend analysis and process comparator. The various process models from learner's data were presented using several visualizations.","","978-1-6654-2013-6","10.1109/C2I454156.2021.9689228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9689228","Process Mining;Flipped Classroom;Heuristic Miner;Fuzzy Miner;Process Comparator","Electronic learning;Computational modeling;Education;Data visualization;Market research;Data models;Telecommunication computing","","2","","12","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The effect of student learning styles on the learning gains achieved when interactive simulations are coupled with real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology","F. V.

Kowalski","Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA; Department of Physics, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA",2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings,"18 Feb 2013","2012","","","1","5","This paper describes results from a project in an undergraduate engineering physics course that coupled classroom use of interactive computer simulations with the collection of real-time formative assessment using pen-enabled mobile technology. Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-1352-0","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462281","learning styles;interactive simulations;real-time formative assessment;active learning;InkSurvey","Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Engineering education;Physics;Integrated circuit modeling;Reliability","","1","","26","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
