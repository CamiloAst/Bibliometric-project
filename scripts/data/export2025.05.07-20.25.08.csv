"Relevance of modeling laser-material interactions in the industrial context","W. Schulz","Fraunhofer ILT, Aachen",2017 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics (CLEO),"26 Oct 2017","2017","","","1","2","Implementing a virtual production system is challenging. Production systems are constrained by different dynamical market changes and characterised by complex general and machine specific interactions, uncertainties and unknowns. These complications make predicting the behaviour by any deterministic computer model not only inaccurate but sometimes misleading, e.g. if the range of a model's applicability is not sufficiently well identified. Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence. The theory of design oriented thinking adapted for manufacturing favours fast iteration in digitised design cycles instead of optimisation of model quality in one step.","","978-1-9435-8027-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8083010","","Numerical models;Data models;Adaptation models;Reduced order systems;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Welding","","","","","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Visual Design Problem-based Learning in a Virtual Environment Improves Computational Thinking and Programming Knowledge","A. Banic; R.

Students solved visual design problems by creating 3D sculptures in an online virtual environment. These creations were further explored and refined in immersive display systems fostering embodied learning and remote peer presence and support. To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses. This work may have a positive impact on computer science education by increasing engagement, knowledge acquisition, and self-directed learning.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798013","Visual Design Problem-based Pedagogy;problem-based learning;Online Virtual Environments;Embodied Learning;Virtual Sculpting;Increase Programming Knowledge;Spatial Art;CCS [Human-centered Computing]: Human-computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms-Virtual Reality;[Human-centered Computing]: CCS Human-computer interaction (HCI);Empirical studies in HCI","Art;Visualization;Virtual environments;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays","","12","","23","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The changes to computational cost and predictive accuracy that result from artificially linearizing certain featural dimensions that are in fact nominal (unstructured) are investigated. It is shown that one must be highly selective in choosing which features to artificially linearize. An information theoretic measure is used to identify a small number of features whose value-sets best differentiate between positive and negative training examples. The resulting algorithm's computational costs approximately double; its predictive accuracy also improves, but, surprisingly, only modestly for the soybean disease dataset which is used as a testbed.<>","","0-7803-0033-5","10.1109/SECON.1991.147773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=147773","","Computational efficiency;Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Computer science;Diseases;Testing;Machine learning;Shape","","","","7","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MC; being inspired from biological reactions occurring inside a living cell; represents a new methodology for writing algorithms and for thinking. In this paper we borrow some immunity flavor and add it to the framework of MC. The new addition is a way of thinking and designing MC algorithms. It eliminates the need for a checking phase in an MC algorithm. There can be many interpretations for the concept of adding Immunity to P systems. In this paper, one interpretation is introduced in which Immunity is interpreted as a set of rules that protects membranes against generation or evolution of unwanted objects. Hence; it is guaranteed that if the system developed an answer then it is correct otherwise the final step will be reached with no membranes.","","978-1-4244-5828-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5461745","Membrane computing;P system;computing machine","Immune system;Biomembranes;Biology computing;Parallel processing;Algorithm design and analysis;Protection;Evolution (biology);Computer architecture;Round robin;Computational modeling","","","","22","","6 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there remains no consensus on its definition or measurement. This study aims to address this gap by developing an instrument to estimate the level of computational thinking using an evidence-centered design approach. The proposed framework integrates cognitive theory, educational research, and psychometric modeling to create a comprehensive and reliable assessment tool. The instrument consists of two scenarios with a total of 59 items divided into six questions. It was validated by experts in the field, achieving a content validity index of 0.76. The test was administered to a sample of 100 students from three secondary schools in Lima, Peru, and analyzed using Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis and parametric tests. The results indicate that the model effectively assesses algorithmic thinking, critical thinking, and problem solving skills, regardless of prior programming experience. However, the assessment of creativity requires further refinement. This research contributes to evidence-based educational policy and practice in secondary education, offering a foundation for future improvements in the evaluation of computational thinking.","","978-1-83724-323-5","10.1049/icp.2025.1239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10975239","","","","","","","","24 Apr 2025","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The unavoidable conclusion is that we have something fundamental to learn from the human brain about a new and much more effective form of computation, with a convenient, effective, efficient and reliable bottom-up (BU) approach. In another paper presented at this conference we focused on the computational information conservation properties of optimized numeric words with precisation of meaning. Here, we present a brain-inspired geometric-logical scheme defining fundamental human linguistic and predicative competence. According to CICT, complete duality of Opposition and Implication Geometry in Logical Geometry and Language can model n-dimensional predicative competence and beyond, according to available computational resources. In any case, their combination may provide even a concrete opportunity for the foundation of computational psychiatry and for reformulating psychoanalytical theory in a sharable way.","","978-1-5386-0771-8","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109761","Cognitive intelligence;computational intelligence;cognitive computing;brain-inspired systems;CICT;deep thinking","Cognition;Computational modeling;Grammar;Brain modeling;Syntactics;Biological system modeling","","6","","13","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
