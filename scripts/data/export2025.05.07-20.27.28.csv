Large Language Models such as ChatGPT have solved various tasks such as text creation and code debugging, and the impact in the field of education has caused close attention from many scholars. Therefore, by establishing an extended TAM, we conducted a questionnaire survey on 470 college students to explore their acceptance of using ChatGPT as an auxiliary learning tool. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the data. The results showed that trust, facilitating conditions, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on college students' use intention of ChatGPT. Hence, by improving the credibility of generated content and providing appropriate auxiliary resources will help promote students' acceptance of ChatGPT. The research results provide suggestions and directions for future design.","2473-3547","979-8-3503-1745-9","10.1109/ISCID59865.2023.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494274","technology acceptance model (TAM);structural equation modeling (SEM);ChatGPT","Surveys;Technology acceptance model;Numerical analysis;Computational modeling;Education;Debugging;Chatbots","","1","","26","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This may be an area that needs more attention in the future. The survey shows that there are professionals at all levels, but also where there are gaps. However, it gives hope that in the coming years these gaps will be filled and more effective lean transformations can be led. The main lessons from the survey can help to set priorities for the coming years. Those in the support phase are the least aware of the importance of a blame-free environment, which is a key factor for effective lean transformation. In the application phase, there is a clear lack of awareness of the Kanban system. The lack of knowledge of plant management is also consistent with the experience. This is also due to the fact that the development of lean was not always based on existing knowledge, but was promoted as a new method different from traditional practices.","2765-818X","979-8-3503-2952-0","10.1109/SACI60582.2024.10619857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10619857","lean strategy;lean transformation;change management;trainer skill","Surveys;Buildings;Informatics;Computational intelligence;Best practices;Business","","","","28","IEEE","12 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The contextual element is composed of three parts: domain, situation and background. The domain is extracted by merging sentences with the same or similar domain conceptual symbol, which comes from the symbols of conceptual primitives, the conceptual symbols of words, and the semantic chunks in a sentence. The conceptual framework of situation is filled with the right words or phrases, according to the knowledge of domain sentence categories, the sentence categories and semantic chunks. The experiments show that there are still many aspects to be improved, including the knowledge base, analyzing the semantic structures of sentences, and matching the conceptual symbols in different types.","","978-1-4244-3835-8","10.1109/AICI.2009.474","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376537","sentence group;domain;situation;HNC theory","Concrete;Merging;Logic;Joining processes;Artificial intelligence;Computational intelligence;Acoustics;Information analysis;Data mining;Frequency","","","","7","IEEE","12 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to support change handling, product modeling in current product lifecycle management (PLM) system uses feature and contextual connection definitions to realize self-adaptive characteristics of product model. Actual problems with this model are identified and recent contributions to establish new modeling solutions are introduced in this paper. The main objectives are to enhance self adaptive characteristics of currently applied product models and to extend contextual connections to new features providing higher level knowledge representation capability. Open architecture PLM system representing latest product modeling principles and methods is considered as environment for the research, simulation, and implementation demanded by the proposed extension using new features and contexts.","","978-1-4799-0063-3","10.1109/ICCCyb.2013.6617571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617571","","Adaptation models;Context modeling;Context;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Adaptive systems","","","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to investigate the mismatch problem in region-related concept detection, we introduce three kinds of methods to annotate the datasets, and then conduct experiments on differently annotated training and testing datasets. We find from these experiments that the detection performance is the best when the regions of a region-related concept are well defined and matched during training and testing, or the detection performance will be decreased. Based on these observations, we propose a fusion scheme to combine the results of classifiers trained with datasets which are annotated by different methods. Experiments on Trecvid-2007 test corpus show that the proposed fusion scheme can obtain performance improvement up to 6~12%.","","978-0-7695-3645-3","10.1109/CINC.2009.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5231605","Region-mismatch;Concept;Detection;Fusion;Annotation;SVM;Trecvid","Testing;Concrete;Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Telephony;Information retrieval;Computational intelligence;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Video sequences","","","","21","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
