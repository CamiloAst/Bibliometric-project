Learning process involves the cognitive ability to grasp and process the information in order to utilize the knowledge effectively. In science education, use of laboratories to supplement learning is integral to overall development of the learner. However, due to numerous challenges such as the lack of effectiveness of practical laboratories to impart conceptual knowledge, the learning goals are compromised. In this work, learning curves are modeled to quantitatively assess the extent of learning using a technology rich Virtual Laboratory platform to teach laboratory experimentation. Two specific skills i.e. thinking skills and design skills were characterized in the assessments. Significant improvements were observed not only in the scores but also the response speed demonstrated by students to complete the assessment.","","978-1-5090-2029-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732187","Learning curve;Rate of learning;Knowledge Transfer;Basic/Content thinking;Design skill","Multimedia communication;Computers;Integrated circuit modeling;Knowledge transfer;Training;Computational modeling","","3","","26","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Educational games hold significant potential to serve as a platform for CS education because they integrate engaging problem solving with effective pedagogical strategies. This potential is especially high for narrative-centered educational games that embed learning activities within rich interactive stories. In this paper, we present an educational game featuring block-based programming challenges contextualized within an engaging narrative, designed to promote CS learning for middle school students (ages 11 to 13). In the game, students undertake problem-solving challenges that are aligned with the K-12 Computer Science Framework. Results from a classroom implementation of the game with middle grade students suggest that their perceived game control ratings are positively correlated with their progress in the game, which suggests the need for adaptively supporting students' game-based learning activities. Building on these findings, we discuss design implications for creating student-adaptive CS learning experiences in educational games that incorporate block-based programming enriched narrative-centered gameplay.","2325-4289","978-1-7281-4533-4","10.1109/CoG47356.2020.9231881","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231881","Game-based learning;Computer science education;Computational thinking;Block-based programming","Games;Programming profession;Education;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Adaptation models;Syntactics","","11","","31","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence. Our model outperforms others in retaining fine detail, improving overall clarity, and maintaining visual integrity. These breakthroughs not only push the frontiers of computational photography but also serve as a catalyst for future advances in image processing and analysis. This study shows that creative thinking unleashes the power of visuals. We use deep learning and adaptive splines to turn burst photographs into everlasting masterpieces that uncover hidden brilliance.","","979-8-3503-5028-9","10.1109/iCACCESS61735.2024.10499637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10499637","Burst photography;Deep learning;Adaptive Neural Splines;Image fusion;Clarity;Detail enhancement;Hidden brilliance;Computational photography","Photography;Visualization;Technological innovation;Image processing;Computational modeling;Surveillance;Neural networks","","1","","21","IEEE","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using GPT-4 as a case study, we designed two agents: IntelliStorm (based on the unstructured brainstorming method) and EvoluTRIZ (based on the structured TRIZ method). Thirty participants were recruited, and through two experimental phases spaced one month apart, a comparative analysis of the effects of collaboration groups (human-agent vs. human-human) and concept generation methods (brainstorming vs. TRIZ) on participants’ physiological activation and creative thinking performance were conducted. The results show that the involvement of LLM-based agents can effectively reduce participants’ electrodermal activity(EDA) response levels, indicating a reduction in cognitive load. Moreover, participants maintained their distinct physiological patterns and performance advantages across different concept generation methods. For example, IntelliStorm, like brainstorming, evokes stronger responses to information stimuli, demonstrating superior thinking fluency; EvoluTRIZ, like the TRIZ, exhibits a higher frequency of information responses, showcasing enhanced thinking elaboration. However, originality tends to favor human-human collaboration. The findings confirm that integrating LLMs with traditional concept generation methods is an effective strategy made possible by combining CoT and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies. In the future, LLM-based agents are expected to achieve broader application in the design field by incorporating additional concept generation methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3494054","Guangdong Province Educational Science Planning Project: Research on the Construction of an Innovative Model for Art Design Course Clusters Driven by Intangible Cultural Heritage Digitalization from the Perspective of Cultural Confidence(grant numbers:2024GXJE108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10747324","LLM-based agent;chain-of-thought fine-tuning;concept generation method;EDA;human-agent collaboration;human-human collaboration","Particle swarm optimization;Heuristic algorithms;Brain modeling;Collaboration;Design methodology;Creativity;Training;Knowledge based systems;Computational modeling;Cognitive load;Large language models","","","","46","CCBYNCND","8 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Within the discipline of computer science, problem decomposition is recognized as a foundational activity of software development. Factors that contribute to the complexity of this activity include: (1) recognizing patterns within an algorithm, (2) mapping the understanding of an algorithm to the syntax of a given programming language, and (3) complexity intrinsic to the problem domain itself. Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain. Performance on outcome measures (a quiz and assignment) were compared between the new method and the traditional teaching method demonstrated that students were significantly more successful at demonstrating mastery when using the new instructional method.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028612","computational thinking;mathematical thinking;visual thinking;spatial reasoning;functional programming","Visualization;Tools;Complexity theory;Animation;Computer science;Labeling;Syntactics","","3","","20","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Broadly, creativity involves a generative step to produce many ideas and a selective step to determine the ones that are the best. Many previous attempts at computational creativity, however, have not been able to achieve a valid selective step. This paper shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with machine learning and data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. To demonstrate our data-driven approach, we developed and deployed a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus, Chef Watson, which can operate either autonomously or semiautonomously with human interaction. We present the basic system architecture, data engineering, and algorithms that are involved. Experimental results demonstrate the system passes the test for creativity based on the consensual assessment technique, producing a novel and flavorful recipe. Large-scale deployments are also discussed.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2019.2893905","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618410","","Creativity;Computational modeling;Computers;Systems architecture;Cats;Correlation;Prediction algorithms","","32","","69","IBM","18 Jan 2019","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Due to privacy concerns, people may hesitate to share their locations and prohibit the growth of location-based services and analysis. The problem of protecting location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user's actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user's sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user. Experiments using real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of privacy, data utility and computational overhead.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxx130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8853131","continuous location-based services and analysis;location privacy;warning zone","","","","","","","30 Sep 2019","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268157","Artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project success;prediction models;systems thinking","Software;Predictive models;Stakeholders;Project management;Artificial neural networks;Systems thinking;Complexity theory","","13","","106","CCBY","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address to this problem, we first provided a binary knowledge model and, then, relaxing some assumptions, allowed for the more realistic framework of partial knowledge which, in turn, adds uncertainty to the assessment of students' knowledge due to their incentive to make a guess in multiple-choice testing. The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy assessment model formalised according to Reiter's Theory of Diagnosis to reduce this uncertainty and to draw a distinction between the level of students' ability and the degree of guessing. The provided assessment model was tested on modelled answers with respect to the knowledge frameworks and validated in a real-world context. The findings of this research present the fuzzy learning performance assessment model which may enable a teacher to estimate the level of partial knowledge and, thus, to specify a student's score as well as the results of computational experiments that confirm the validity of the theoretical outcomes.","","978-1-4673-9481-9","10.1109/CEEC.2015.7332701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332701","Adaptive learning;Bloom's taxonomy;decision making;internal uncertainty;multiple-choice testing;fuzzy logic","Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Decision making;Testing;Analytical models;Computer science;Taxonomy","","1","","36","IEEE","23 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
