Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757410","","Education;Programming profession;Computers;Computational modeling;Australia","","122","","102","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The project addresses two general issues: the breadth of and interactions between knowledge needed for creative reasoning, and the amount of knowledge needed to describe mechanical devices, their behavior, function, and use. This approach supports mechanical improvisation by applying the concept of device functional equivalence in different situations. The discussion covers the following: two classes of individual objects used by EDISON, device behavior and function, device use in problem-solving situations, and functional similarity and improvisation.<>","2374-9407","","10.1109/64.120684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=120684","","Computational modeling;Lifting equipment;Humans;Problem-solving;Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Zinc;Graphics;Art","","23","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Davy",University of Tübingen; University of Sydney,IEEE Wireless Communications,"24 Feb 2021","2021","28","1","152","159","The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) first appeared a few decades ago. Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.001.2000250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9265517","","Computational modeling;Wireless communication;Ubiquitous computing;Internet of Things;Optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Predictive models;Decision making","","9","","18","IEEE","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"A Computational Model of Focused Attention Meditation and Its Transfer to a Sustained Attention Task","A. J. Moye; M.

Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2908172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676257","Focused attention meditation;mindfulness;sustained attention;SART;Prims;transfer;emotion regulation","Computational modeling;Mood;Monitoring;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Emotion recognition","","4","","60","IEEE","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.","","978-1-7281-6929-3","10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185512","Opponent Modelling;Real-Time Strategy;Statistical Forward Planning;Evolutionary Algorithms;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Games;Computational modeling;Force;Planning;Adaptation models;Robustness;Predictive models","","4","","37","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It forms the basis for many advanced topics and is crucial for a well-rounded academic foundation. Mathematical modeling, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for addressing real-world problems by creating abstract models. It is widely applied in fields like economics, industry, medicine, and social sciences. With the rapid advancement of computer technology, mathematical modeling has evolved significantly. Tools like MATLAB have become essential for developing and analyzing complex models, enabling the resolution of intricate problems that are difficult to solve manually. The integration of computer technology into mathematical modeling enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of problem-solving.Given these advancements, it is crucial for colleges and universities to incorporate computer-based mathematical modeling into their curriculum. By integrating these techniques into advanced mathematics courses, educators can create a more cohesive learning experience that combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications. This approach not only improves the quality of mathematics education but also better prepares students to apply their mathematical skills to real-world challenges, equipping them for professional success in a rapidly changing world.","","979-8-3315-0661-2","10.1109/ICBASE63199.2024.10762190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10762190","Advanced Mathematics;Mathematical Modeling;Computational Tools;Curriculum Integration","Economics;Adaptation models;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Education;Social sciences;Stochastic processes;Mathematical models;Software engineering","","","","10","IEEE","26 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
