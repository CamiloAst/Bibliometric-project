This creates the need for a carefully planned educational approach involving different stakeholders as policymakers, educators and students. These stakeholders are the main carriers of the educational reforms thus their perspectives create various challenges and risks. In this paper, we propose a pedagogical approach of teaching coding through games and gamification of the learning process. The flipped classroom is used in order to address the shortcomings in teacher training and deliver learning outcomes in student-centred, fun and engaging way. Proposed solution includes a spiral curriculum implemented in 4 cycles that alternate cooperative and individual learning approach. The approach was evaluated with more than 199 students from 6 different schools. Evaluation analyses were focused on the achieved learning experience identifying differences between male and female students, as well as students with different level of access to ICT resources. The results confirm the benefits of the proposed solution.","2470-6698","978-1-5386-6522-0","10.1109/TALE.2018.8615334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615334","coding;programming;computational thinking;gamification;primary schools","Education;Games;Encoding;Tools;Programming profession;Online services","","7","","43","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research has shown that abstract idea and invisible phenomena can be learned better with the support of AR. However, high complexity and conceptual Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithm design and related programming concepts, are rarely studied empirically in the intersection with immersive technology. This study is aimed at addressing this issue and providing a piece of quantitative and empirical evidence to AR-supported Computer Science discipline-based learning. We designed a mobile AR-enabled application based on a CT framework and related AR affordances in the literature. This app can contextualize a programming debugging task and support program editing & CT learning. A controlled laboratory study was designed and conducted. The result of statistical analyses shows that participants with the AR support made better quality of programs with lower errors and less amount of code edits, compared to those without the AR support.","","978-1-7348995-0-4","10.23919/iLRN47897.2020.9155152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155152","augmented reality;debugging practices;learn to code;computational thinking;computer science education;collaborative learning;mobile app","Visualization;Task analysis;Debugging;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Computed tomography","","5","","17","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is widely defined as a set of skills, such as problem solving and systems design, that rely on Computer Science principles. As these skills are increasingly demanded in modern society, it is critical to include CT in K-12 education to boost not only computing courses, but various other disciplines. However, most educators do not yet know the basics of CT and Computer Science fundamentals, particularly in Brazil. In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028492","Computational Thinking;K-12 Education;Teacher Education;Distance Learning","Computed tomography;Programming profession;Computer aided instruction;Tools","","4","","18","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development. We discuss the impact of this approach on cybersecurity and CT learning and then present future directions for this work.","2470-6698","978-1-7281-6942-2","10.1109/TALE48869.2020.9368459","National Security Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9368459","K-12 STEM education;educational robotics;cybersecurity;computational thinking;collaboration","Knowledge engineering;Collaboration;Computer security;Robots;Programming profession;STEM;Programming environments","","3","","30","IEEE","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To design such a program it is necessary to have a deep knowledge about the meaning of CT and its targets. Although CT skills are of paramount importance to all (since they bring numerous advantages for problem solving activities), in our context we see them as a pre-requisite for the learning of Computer Programming (CP). In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP. The outcome, OntoCnE (that stands for Ontologia para Computação na Escola in Portuguese), made clear what shall be trained in terms of reasoning to understand programming and being able to use it to solve problems using the computer. Moreover, OntoCnE also provides a clear insight on the concepts to be taught in each scholar year, as well as, on the instruments (hereafter called Learning Resources, LR) to be used in each moment for each specific purpose. This paper aims to introduce OntoCnE and demonstrates how to use it to classify LRs aiming to build a repository from where they can be picked up in a clear way. Finally, we demonstrate, through the PathIt resource, how the characterization of a concrete LR is performed in OntoCnE.","2476-2172","979-8-3503-2931-5","10.1109/SIIE59826.2023.10423710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423710","Computational Thinking;Ontology;OntoCnE;Learning Resources","Training;Instruments;Ontologies;Cognition;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Guidelines","","2","","25","IEEE","8 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several studies claim that students have deficits in many of the CT skills and therefore it is important to develop and improve these skills. For that purpose, Teachers responsible for the children’s education have to plan as soon as possible effective ways for training CT skills. There are already many Learning Resources (LR) for this training, however, we believe that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the impact of these LR in the teaching and learning process. Currently, Educational Neuroscience presents a solid set of scientific evidence on how the brain learns more effectively. This important knowledge about the brain’s learning process can be turned into principles applicable in Education. This paper starts emphasising those principles that can benefit the teaching and learning process. Based on this scientific evidence, we propose the adoption of a set of guidelines that can contribute to innovative CT training. Neuroeducation applies the latest theoretical advances in the human brain and psychology to pedagogy. The guidelines inspired by Neuroeducation that we propose here aim to provide instructions for the teacher to apply in their pedagogical practices and in LR, in order to promote more effective training. One concrete LR for primary school, created by our Master’s Students in Computing Education, will be used, as a case study, to illustrate our proposal.","2476-2172","979-8-3503-2931-5","10.1109/SIIE59826.2023.10423685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423685","Computational Thinking;Neuroeducation;Pedagogy;Learning Resources","Training;Neuroscience;Psychology;Ontologies;Proposals;Programming profession;Guidelines","","1","","63","IEEE","8 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272483","computational thinking;competency-based education;educational infrastructure","Education;Computer science;Standards;Stakeholders;Engineering profession;Encoding;Statistics","","","","15","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the objectivity of the previous methods for assigning assessment indicators of CT is insufficient. Therefore, the paper proposed to use the XGBoost machine learning model to fit the assessment data, fully explore the data features and realize the weighting of CT assessment indicators. The CT assessment indicators are used as the features of XGBoost model training and the assessment levels are used as the training labels to obtain the feature weights through XGBoost model training. The feature weights are used as the CT assessment indicator weights to realize the weighting of assessment indicators of CT in reverse. From the analysis of the CT assessment indicator assignment results, the analysis of the importance of the assessment indicators and the comparative analysis of the assessment results before and after the indicator assignment, it is found that the CT assessment after the indicator assignment has higher robustness and credibility.","","979-8-3503-0706-1","10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00024","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61977031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496935","Computational thinking;XGBoost;Assessment indicators;Indicator weight","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Conferences;Machine learning;Data models;Robustness","","","","20","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To increase minority students’ interest and engagement in computing, a researcher-practitioner partnership between the University of Texas at El Paso and the El Paso Independent School District, developed and implemented a culturally and linguistically responsive curriculum and pedagogy to introduce computational thinking (CT) in two middle schools across different subject areas in a borderland region. The curriculum leveraged the Sol y Agua game – a bilingual, culturally-responsive game designed to engage students of this region in CT. This paper describes the process and initial findings of this project. The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386409","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386409","Computational thinking;K-12 education;Computer games","Systematics;Education;Curriculum development;Collaboration;Games;Switches;Linguistics","","","","29","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
