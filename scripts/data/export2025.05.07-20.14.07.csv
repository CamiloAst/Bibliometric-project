In this article, we show how to use the Regulated Activation Network (RAN) cognitive model to reconstruct abstract concepts and their blends. The MNIST dataset is used in this work to build a representation of abstract concepts. For the demonstration, three experiments were designed: first, shows how a high dimensional input image is encoded into a low dimension vector and further reconstructed back into an image; second, reconstruction of blends of abstract concepts that represent same digits; third, reconstructing blends of abstract concepts which represent different digits. The reconstructed images in all three experiments were visually analyzed. The best reconstructions were observed with the encoded image experiment obtaining Mean Squared Error of 0.00562 and an Rsquare score of 0.9193. The blends of similar abstract concepts also reconstructed the expected blend of a digit. The blends of dissimilar abstract concepts reconstructed the images by creating interesting symbols such as character x.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207232","Computational Creativity;Concept Blending;Dimension Reduction;Concept Reconstruction;Computational Modeling","Image reconstruction;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Creativity;Visualization;Data models;Artificial intelligence","","1","","21","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we explore the impact of the global pandemic on a massive open online course, Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking, with a particular focus on the topics learners chose for their final projects. The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2020.3024012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222821","","Pandemics;Electronic learning;COVID-19;Computer aided instruction;Problem-solving","","8","","10","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The study takes place in a U.S. school district whose percentages of Latino/a students, language learners, and low-income students are among the highest in the nation. The project is among the first to examine the linguistic and sociocultural factors that facilitate the success of multilingual students in mastering computational thinking. Utilizing principles of Design-Based Implementation Research in alignment with the RPP approach, researchers worked collaboratively with teachers and administrators to identify problems of practice in computer science education specific to the district. A broad survey of national and regional computer science initiatives was conducted to identify effective approaches for teaching computational thinking to diverse learners. As a result of this survey, the RPP identified a pathbreaking curriculum that aligns with the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 standards to pilot in five classrooms in the first year of the RPP. The curriculum was further revised to align with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and the California English Language Development standards during a week-long summer institute. This paper describes these experiences, highlighting the integration of computational thinking into an English Language Arts curriculum as well as the linguistic scaffolding strategies utilized to better meet the needs of multilingual students. This experience report uncovers pedagogical practices of computational thinking for diverse students and identifies areas for future work.","","978-1-7281-0821-6","10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985944","","","","4","","9","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Computational Thinking is an approach of teaching that uses a diverse range of techniques derived from computers for the resolution of these problems combined with the new competencies of the 21st century (critical thinking, collaboration, etc.). The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way. Admittedly, it grows the idea that the Computing discipline is very distinct from the computer classes and that the use of skills from Computing possesses educational (reflection and problem solving, the comprehension that the world is ingrained with the digital technology) and economic (high demand of professionals with good training) benefits.

Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM. The results also provide valuable insights and motivation for further development of educational games within the SciMaG project.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893066","STEM;games;computational thinking;science outreach;SciMaG project","Educational robots;Education;Games;Strategic planning;Teamwork;Problem-solving;STEM","","","","40","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928684","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61304210); Humanities and Social Science Programming Foundation of Ministry of Education in China(grant numbers:19YJA630031); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2017J01496); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:GY-Z15107); Scientific Research Foundation of the Fujian University of Technology(grant numbers:GY-Z160125); Traffic Science and Technology Project of Shandong Province in China(grant numbers:2016B35); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8762009","Logistics;scheduling;freight containers;computational modeling;computational complexity;decision making;numerical simulation;computational logistics;logistics generalized computation for container terminal","Containers;Logistics;Planning;Cranes;Resource management;Optimization;Mathematical model","","11","","69","CCBY","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent basic studies reveal that AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the adoption of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from the deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by a cognitive systems. A fundamental theory and novel technology for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra, and inference algebra.","","978-1-5090-3846-6","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862095","Cognitive informatics;cognitive computers;cognitive robotics;brain-inspired systems;deep learning;deep reasoning;deep thinking;knowledge learning;denotational mathematics;mathematical engineering","","","23","","","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637416","ERASMUS+ project(grant numbers:2019-1-LT01-KA203-060767); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637416","computational thinking;machine learning;programming paradigms;artificial intelligence;data agency","Training;Limiting;Conferences;Education;Data visualization;Parallel processing;Fish","","13","","45","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a new algorithm, the Concrete-Category Overlap (CCO) algorithm, that distinguishes between literal and metaphorical use of adjective-noun relationships and evaluate it on two data sets of adjective-noun phrases. Our results point to the superiority of the CCO algorithm to past and contemporary approaches in determining the presence and conceptual significance of metaphors, and provide a better understanding of the conditions under which each algorithm should be applied.","","978-1-4673-5871-2","10.1109/CCMB.2013.6609166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609166","computational intelligence;natural language processing;metaphor;computational linguistics","Decision support systems;Computational intelligence;Handheld computers;Abstracts","","11","2","17","IEEE","26 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
