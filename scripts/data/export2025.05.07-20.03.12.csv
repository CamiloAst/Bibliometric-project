Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.","","978-1-6654-1680-1","10.1109/SEA-STEM53614.2021.9668107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668107","computational thinking;need assessment;gamification;computational thinking with coding","Systematics;Navigation;Education;Games;Programming;Encoding;Pattern recognition","","1","","31","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. There have been various approaches to teach computational thinking in early education stages that utilize modern technologies, such as physical computing and robotics, and adopt a playful manner. Mobile Augmented Reality is a promising technology along this path that lets users collaborate and interact with both physical and digital elements. However, the technology is still relatively new and has not been studied extensively with students, especially in formal educational settings. In this paper we present ARQuest, a collaborative mobile augmented reality game for developing computational thinking skills of primary school students. The game combines a physical board and tangible tokens with animated 3D content, and students use them to create and solve challenges in a gamified environment. We have performed an exploratory study in two primary schools in order to explore the impact of ARQuest on students' understanding of algorithmic concepts, engagement and collaboration. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the game, as well as more generic aspects of interacting and collaborating in mobile augmented reality.","2474-0489","978-1-7281-4540-2","10.1109/VS-Games.2019.8864603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864603","computational thinking;mobile augmented reality;tangible augmented reality;game-based learning;collaborative learning","Games;Education;Programming profession;Augmented reality;Problem-solving","","30","","34","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking is advocated as not only a fundamental skill or concept in computer science but also a core competency for all disciplines. Teaching students in non-computer science majors computing thinking is challenging because students do not have experts' mental models. This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms. Addressing these problems early and explicitly in future classes could improve the education of computational thinking and alleviate difficulties students may experience in using computational thinking in learning and problem solving.","2377-634X","978-1-61284-469-5","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142980","Computational Thinking;Computer Science Education;Spreadsheet Functions;Problem Solving","Problem-solving;Computer science;Computers;Conferences;Educational institutions;Instruments","","10","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A Model of Computational Creativity based on Engram Cell Theory","Q. Li; B.

In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets","","979-8-3503-3984-0","10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195075","creative thinking;engram cell theory;computational model;language generation;puzzle solution","Training;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Brain modeling;Physiology;Creativity;Python","","","","5","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
