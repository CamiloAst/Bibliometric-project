The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.","","978-1-4244-3581-4","10.1109/ETCS.2009.120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4958823","computational tools;computational thinking;computational methods","Humans;Computer science;Biology computing;Computer science education;Educational technology;Technological innovation;History;Evolution (biology);Computational intelligence;Face","","3","","6","IEEE","26 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-6262-9","10.1109/FIE.2010.5673139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673139","Abstraction;Algorithm;Computational Math;Model;Thinking","Computers;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Books;Mathematical model","","10","","25","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.","","979-8-3503-0706-1","10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00025","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61977031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496944","computational thinking;computational thinking assessment;iceberg model;assessment framework;computational thinking education","Computational modeling;Conferences;Education;Psychology;Icebergs;Artificial intelligence;Testing","","","","15","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to “unlock” their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-5261-1","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685067","CS1;Creative Thinking;Computational Thinking;College;Computer Science","Ciphers;Reflection;Writing;Computer science;Data collection;Debugging;Educational institutions","","31","","19","IEEE","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
