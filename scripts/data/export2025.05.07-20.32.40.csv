"A reconstruction method of the design rationale model based on design context","J. Liu; Hongfei Zhan","School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Beihang University, Beijing, China",2013 10th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD),"19 May 2014","2013","","","492","497","Design rationale (DR) explains the product design decision-making process and the reason behind the decision. Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction. Partial design process of the POGO mechanical system design is taken as an example to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.","","978-1-4673-5253-6","10.1109/FSKD.2013.6816247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816247","Design rationale;Design evolution;Design iteration;Model reconstruction","Context;Context modeling;Computational modeling;Reconstruction algorithms;Design methodology;Decision making;Educational institutions","","3","","13","IEEE","19 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem is widely applied in many fields such as physics, economics, etc. Systems for automatic solving integral problems are necessary tools in education. They support students and teachers in learning and teaching. Current computer algebra systems such as Maple, Mathematica, etc can solve integral problems. However, they output the result only or are limited to give the complete solution. This paper presents a model for representing knowledge about single variable functions and proposes some algorithms for solving integral problem automatically. These algorithms mimic the human way of thinking and produce the solution that explains the calculus process.","","978-1-4244-9718-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2011.6028741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6028741","Artificial intelligence;knowledge representation;computer education;educational software;automatic problems solving","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Software;Humans;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge representation","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of a graduate seminar, the students were organized in teams and were asked to design a serious game. In the early stages of the process, each team had the possibility to engage in a topic suggested by the professor or decide their topic of interest. Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.","","978-1-4673-8243-4","10.1109/IMCTL.2015.7359615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359615","game design;game creation;creativity;digital game based learning","Games;Collaboration;Context;Education;Analytical models;Computational modeling","","1","","25","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578896","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Computer vision;Adaptation models;Quality assurance;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Collaboration;Problem-solving","","","","16","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption. Therefore, the model attains superior security and efficiency.","","979-8-3503-9324-8","10.1109/ICCAKM58659.2023.10449649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10449649","secure mobile communication;homogeneous;heterogeneous;signcryption;mutual communication","Measurement;Adaptation models;5G mobile communication;Computational modeling;Public key;Mathematical models;Communications technology","","","","32","IEEE","8 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation.
