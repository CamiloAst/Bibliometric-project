In addition, a practical autonomous vehicle set was utilized to explore the team research outcomes. The final student team outcomes as well as feedback and the corresponding surveys, evaluated by the project administrators, indicate the success of the effective research component inclusion in an undergraduate service course.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-6151-3","10.1109/CSCI62032.2023.00271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10590590","Undergraduate in-class research;hands-on;service course","Surveys;Electromagnetic devices;Scientific computing;Systems operation;Circuits;Heat engines;Ventilation","","","","25","IEEE","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework of directed health learning is based on 7x2C content knowledge established criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. The self-design frame framework is plan-oriented and based on the concept of a plan and plans integrations and special relationships. The user is directed to break the system into plans and the design is to self-guide the user to build a system to comprehend, combat, coexist, cope, and trace COVID-19 with four layers of diagnostics, simulation, and pattern matching database. With the collaboration of users' systems, a fact from one user as output can be transferred to another user as an input in a circulation forming a general fact. Consequently, the transfer of learning from one system flows into another system resulting in a pattern to be found. Based on the pattern an algorithm will formulate to tackle a solution to COVID19. The implication of this study will be a guideline for others to initiate their own participant's system to find a pattern and formulate an algorithm for the pandemic. The idea of self-design and self-directed learning can be transferred to other fields of study covid-19 health.

The widespread use of these applications relies on a mixture of experts (MoE), which contains multiple experts, and selectively engages them for each task to lower operation costs while maintaining performance. Despite MoE, GAI faces challenges in resource consumption when deployed on user devices. Hence, this article proposes mobile edge networks supported MoE-based GAI. We first review the MoE from traditional AI and GAI perspectives, including structure, principles, and applications. We then propose a framework that transfers subtasks to experts in mobile edge networks, aiding GAI model operation on user devices. We discuss challenges in this process and introduce a deep rein-forcement learning-based algorithm to select edge experts for subtask execution. Experimental results show that our framework not only facilitates GAI's deployment on resource-limited devices, but also generates higher-quality content compared to methods without edge network support.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.003.2400046","National Research Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102099); Ministry of Education; IITP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10707053","","Computational modeling;Training;Signal to noise ratio;Generative AI;Neural networks;Adaptation models;Data models;Costs;Chatbots;Scalability;Multi-access edge computing","","1","","15","IEEE","7 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A cell in a spreadsheet holds one specific value and gives a discrete, overprecise view of the underlying model. Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells. To evaluate its usability and the perceived mental effort required, we conducted a user study. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional spreadsheets in terms of answer correctness, response time, and perceived mental effort in almost all tasks tested.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3119212","FFG(grant numbers:881844); Austrian COMET Program Competence Centers for Excellent Technologies; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Provinces of Upper Austria and Styria; State of Upper Austria and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research(grant numbers:LIT-2019-7-SEE-117); Federal State of Upper Austria; Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie; Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft; Styria; SFG and Vienna Business Agency(grant numbers:854174); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566799","Uncertainty visualization;tabular data;spreadsheet augmentation","Uncertainty;Costs;Automobiles;Tools;Visualization;Computational modeling;Maintenance engineering","","","","58","IEEE","11 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This dynamicity imposes strong requirements on the way systems are designed, installed, operated, and reengineered. Re-configurability is not enough.

In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.","","978-1-4799-3592-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821824","ICT;K-12 education;computing curriculum;Delphi method","Education;Standards;Government","","3","","10","IEEE","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
