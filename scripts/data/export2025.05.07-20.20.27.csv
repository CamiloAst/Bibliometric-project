The analysis of the available foreign and domestic interpretations of the concept of “political socialization” is carried out. The author's understanding of the political socialization of the individual is substantiated. The structural components of the political socialization of youth are highlighted, taking into account the age stage. The period of secondary socialization allowed the authors to identify four blocks - components of political socialization, which formed the basis of the questionnaire. Automation of the process of presenting the methodology and processing the survey data allows the respondent to get an idea of their own level of political socialization, and developers to route the individual - the need to eliminate gaps in political socialization by recommending the passage of certain correctional and developmental activities through the information and educational platform model being created in the future. The testing of the automated version of the methodology has shown its effectiveness in quickly and correctly determining the level of political socialization of young people. The technique can be used for both individual and group work.","","978-1-6654-5659-3","10.1109/SUMMA57301.2022.9973909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973909","automation of methodology;political socialization of youth;political experience;patriotism;civic responsibility;critical thinking;ideological position of youth","Visualization;Automation;Computational modeling;Switches;Control systems;Data models;Mathematical models","","","","11","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Optimizing URL Phishing Detection: A Manifold Learning Approach with an Efficient Neural Network Focused on Reducing Computational Cost","V. V. M","Department of Computer Science, University of Madras, Chennai, India","2024 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS)","2 Apr 2024","2024","","","1","6","The growing number of phishing attacks is one of the top concerns of cybersecurity researchers. Cryptographic methods are not reliable in stopping phishing attacks because they manipulate the users into thinking it is safe to access a web link. This results in compromise of sensitive information. Recent research has shown how machine learning methods are capable of detecting malicious websites. However, machine learning models can be computationally heavy to produce good accuracy. This paper focuses on reducing the computational cost while maintaining an effective prediction model. The experiment is conducted on a dataset of size (30, 10000), consisting of phishing and benign website links. The Isomap algorithm is implemented to reduce the input dimension while preserving correlation. Subsequently, a neural network is employed, utilizing simple activation and optimization functions to ensure efficient and rapid prediction. The model achieves an accuracy of 87% under 30 training epochs.","2688-0288","979-8-3503-4846-0","10.1109/SCEECS61402.2024.10482207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10482207","Phishing;Manifold Learning;Neural Networks;Computational Cost;Optimization","Uniform resource locators;Training;Computational modeling;Phishing;Neural networks;Machine learning;Predictive models","","","","15","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition. Our work suggests that educators and developers of educational VR simulations, who want to enhance knowledge and understanding as well as simultaneous acquisition of multiple abstract concepts, can do so by employing immersion and self-avatars in VR learning experiences.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3169426","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS 1344228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762800","Computer science education;embodied cognition;immersion;self-avatars;VR in middle school education;virtual reality","Programming profession;Cognition;Training;Task analysis;STEM;Solid modeling;Virtual environments","Humans;Immersion;Computer Graphics;Virtual Reality;Learning;Schools","14","","62","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in which programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain program behavior, or to uncover bugs. This paper presents Calypso, a language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for programming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a virtual world. The initial implementation of Calypso uses the Cozmo robot by Anki. Like Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws. An understanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental model of computation. Calypso provides a variety of affordances and scaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental models and facilitate computational thinking.","","978-1-5386-2480-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2017.8120416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120416","Cozmo robot;mobile robots;robot programming","Games;Robot sensing systems;Cognitive science;Computer bugs;Programming;Cameras","","11","","17","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This change in skillset needed for careers has strongly impacted mathematics curriculum and assessment. Meaningful assessment involves examining students' ability to inquire, to reason on targeted questions or tasks, and to promote conceptual understanding, not just focusing on discreet facts and principles. Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling. The assessment using Netlogo would be very useful for math educators to have good tools to assess students' conceptual understanding, as well as to develop instructional strategies used.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-5261-1","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685135","STEM;procedural knowledge;conceptual knowledge;NetLogo;Assessment","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Calculus;Educational institutions;Analytical models","","3","","18","IEEE","19 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our hypothesis is that computer simulations showing the solutions to the differential equations that govern the fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer within the equipment will solidify the link between experiment and theory and provide improved learning. Students in one lab section who used the simulations were compared to those in a control section who did not. A diagnostic quiz given before and after each lab provided a quantitative measure of improvement in learning via the lab experience for both groups. Content analysis of written and oral reports was used to measure any difference in higher level thinking demonstrated by the two groups. Student attitudes towards the simulations were assessed by surveys and end-of-course evaluations. Results so far, in the second year of a three-year project, indicate improvements in student satisfaction and learning but little change in critical thinking that can be attributed to the simulations.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-1969-2","10.1109/FIE.2008.4720608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4720608","Laboratory improvement;computer modeling;unit operations;learning assessment","Joining processes;Laboratories;Computational modeling;Fluid flow;Finite element methods;Software packages;Biomembranes;Computer simulation;Differential equations;Heat transfer","","1","","4","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those being abstraction, decomposition, pattern recognition, and generalisation, among others, which are fundamental for problem-solving. What is more, Logic Programming helps building up Logical Thinking skills, also distinguishing valid arguments from fallacies and contradictions, as well as establishing connections between arguments through reasoning, to name some. These practices are not only essential for the development of knowledge in STEM, but also in Computer Science disciplines. Recently, arguments have been standing in favour of the early integration of programming within compulsory education. The international scientific community is looking forward to researching and initiatives being deployed towards this direction. This article introduces Metagame -Metajuego-, a methodological proposal which integrates key aspects to facilitate the effective integration of Logic Programming in primary education through collaborative and gamifying strategies. Furthermore, concrete cases of games are presented which have been formulated thanks to applying the proposed methodological approach to different educational contexts.

Yet, its use for teaching programming with university-level non-STEM audiences has not been researched so far. This work presents a new educational activity designed for teaching programming to non-STEM university-level audiences. The key aspect is a separation of teaching programming concepts and programming language and; therefore, complexity reduction in learning. The concepts are introduced using educational robotics and later on students learn how to use the concepts in the context of the Python programming language. Two teaching approaches, direct instruction and productive failure, along with a capstone challenge are deployed and their relationship to educational robotics is observed.","","978-1-6654-5331-8","10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398343","Interactive learning environments;Collaborative learning;Human Computer Interaction;Educational Robotics;Programming Education;Productive failure","Education;Complexity theory;Robots;Programming profession;Python","","","","20","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
