"An Expression-Oriented Approach to Programming Education","E. Alda; J. Baralt-Torrijos","Universidad Simón Bolívar, Venezuela; Universidad Simón Bolívar, Venezuela",2023 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"23 Jan 2024","2023","","","282","285","Learning programming language syntax is considered an obstacle in programming education. However, we believe it is an overlooked opportunity to exploit obvious synergies with Math. As evidenced around the world, middle and high school students know the syntax required to compute simple expressions, without previous exposure to programming languages. We make the case for an “expressions first” approach to facilitate the development of computational thinking. Our approach has the benefit of integrating directly with Math, which in turn reinforces the teaching of other STEM subjects as well as non-STEM ones. We report early results of an ongoing trial using a visual computing environment that supports this approach.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-0001-7","10.1109/ISEC57711.2023.10402150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10402150","Programming Education;Computational Thinking;Expression-Oriented Programming;Spreadsheets","Computer languages;Visualization;Education;Syntactics;Programming profession;STEM","","","","8","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, this study combined the jigsaw pedagogy with unplugged activities and verified the teaching effect of such a combination through randomized group experiments. The results of the study showed that the combination of the jigsaw pedagogy and the unplugged activities was more conducive to promoting students' motivation and the development of computational thinking than the unplugged activity alone. Drawing upon the research findings, this study concluded with several implications for teachers to reform information technology classrooms in unplugged environments.","","979-8-3503-5180-4","10.1109/CSTE62025.2024.00072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589996","jigsaw pedagogy;information technology;unplugged activity;learning motivation;computational thinking","Computer science;Education;Information technology","","","","11","IEEE","18 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Developing a Game to Assess Abstraction Skills of Elementary Students: Design Principles and Validation Process","Q. Luo; S.

Although there are existing tools to measure CT practices, improvements can be made in terms of their assessment formats and data analysis methods. To address this gap, this study develops Critters Puzzle (CP), a game-based assessment tool aimed at measuring primary school students’ CT practices, specifically abstraction skills. Based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, 12 progressively challenging tasks were developed. To ensure the content validity of the tool, validation was put forward involving expert review and students’ cognitive interviews. Twenty-two experts were invited to review the appropriateness of the measurement and seven students (aged 6–10) were invited for interviews to evaluate the usability of the platform and its effectiveness as an assessment tool. Results indicated that the game is engaging, understandable, and appropriately challenging for students, and several modifications were made to the game based on the feedback from experts and interviewees. Future research will involve empirical studies to validate the game's psychometric properties, including its reliability and validity, as an assessment tool for CT practices.","","979-8-3503-7694-4","10.1109/ICET62460.2024.10868477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10868477","computational thinking;abstraction;game-based assessment;primary education","Data analysis;Reviews;Games;Educational technology;Aging;Reliability;Interviews;Usability","","","","26","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is equivalent to finding a path through the graph of possible problem states from an initial node to a goal node. The search is usually conducted by an algorithm or by a human through an iterative process of selecting and applying operators to states found so far. Here, I demonstrate examples of searching in problem spaces via interactive drawing. The demonstrations help to elucidate issues in the design of new problem-solving affordances that may enhance the abilities of human solvers to understand and solve problems. This opens up new ways to conceptualize the process of solving problems, and it suggests new ways to teach a form of computational thinking.","","978-1-4673-7457-6","10.1109/VLHCC.2015.7357243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357243","problem solving;problem space graph;visualization;drawing;state-space search;computational thinking;Towers of Hanoi;Missionaries and Cannibals","Visualization;Pipelines","","","","7","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620708","computing pathways;computational thinking;empathy interviews;inclusive computing","Computer science;Protocols;Instruments;Urban areas;Interviews","","","","9","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620568","rural education;computing pathways;equitable access to computer science education;computational thinking;professional development;broadening participation in computing","Computer science;Handheld computers;Education;Global communication;Cultural differences;Videoconferences","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
