Aiming to assessing the Computational Thinking skills of a Scratch program, we design and implement a new Scratch program analysis tool based on ANTLR. To solve some flaws (e.g., high failure rate and low efficiency) in Dr. Scratch which is the most relevant tool to assess Computational Thinking skills of Scratch programs, we choose the recognition tool ANTLR to design the system module and the assessing flow. And then, we customize more than 200 lexical and syntax parser rules in ANTLR. Furthermore, we expand the grading standard of assessing Computational Thinking skills in Dr. Scratch. Some fundamental concepts in Computer Science, such as stack, queue and recursion method, are involved in our grading standard. Experiment results show the performance (e.g., success rate, execution time) of SAT is superior to that of Dr. Scratch.","2376-6506","978-1-5386-2070-0","10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450296","Analysis Tool;Scratch;Computational Thinking;ANTLR","Tools;Syntactics;Standards;Visualization;Python;Grammar","","25","","14","IEEE","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By teaching and learning subjects independently, students are limited to subject-oriented problems, which are not in reality. To address these flaws, integrating knowledge across disciplines becomes significantly necessary. In the past years, STEM has been accepted as one of the effective strategies to bridge the difference in nature of each field to construct more practical projects and innovations. Moreover, the educational robot can be employed as a learning tool in that strategy since it not only provides challenging learning missions but also promotes computational thinking for the students. Therefore, this research study proposed STEM learning activities on three-day workshop to lay out the foundation to the high-school science-and-technology students who are becoming the engineering students. The workshop comprises of eight phases to facilitate their learning inquiry process with hands-on experience; moreover, the activities were designed in consideration of promoting computational thinking with challenging learning missions. The findings of this study showed that the proposed workshop activities are beneficial for the students who outperformed on robotics with higher computational thinking; meanwhile, they could provide more relevant responses regarding the proposed learning activities.","","978-1-5386-7447-5","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693259","STEM;computational thinking;educational robot;engineering education","Conferences;STEM;Programming profession;Robot sensing systems","","11","","17","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Background: In the field of computer science, computational thinking is defined as a method that enhances problem-solving skills, system design, and human behavior understanding. Over the last few decades, several tools have been proposed for the development of computational thinking skills; however, there is no area of study that evaluates the implications or the impact that these types of platforms have on users belonging to any knowledge area. Research Question: Do user interfaces influence the development of computational thinking skills? Methodology: To address this issue, a systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) methodology for analyzing and evaluating scientific publications. Findings: The results show that despite the dearth of literature on the subject, the specific design of a user interface has a significant impact on the development of computational thinking. Bearing the above in mind, it is necessary to conduct research that delves more deeply into the effects caused by the technologies that are used to develop computational thinking, this being a line of research that is worthy of consideration.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2022.3159765","Cabildo de Tenerife.

Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342931","game-based learning (GBL);design-based research (DBR);computational thinking;computer science;undergraduate;constructivist;constructionist;analog","Surveys;Education;Digital simulation;Games;Solids;Reflection;Computer science education","","","","30","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game.

Through Computational Thinking, human can solve problems by using computer more efficiently. Therefore, the cultivation of Computational Thinking's ability was particularly important in teaching. But Computational Thinking cannot be taught without carrier and the programing course was the best way for they were closely related with each other. The paper took the Maze Problem as an example to express the differences between human and computer in the aspects of storage structure, thinking mode, solving procedure, etc. and it compared the human brain's multi-dimension and multi-forms characteristics with the computer's ne-dimension and one-form characteristics.
