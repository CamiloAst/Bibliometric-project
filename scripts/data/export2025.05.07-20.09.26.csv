These shortages in case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GA) were analyzed by the model. It was proved that the fundamental reason of these shortages is that they only can simulate a single process in the model of creative thinking. Then a simulation algorithm of directed similarity association is brought forward so as to realize the computation of similarity degree of product demand between components, and simulate the whole model of creative thinking by combining CBR and GA. A corresponding product design system was put forward, and then an experiment was conducted, and the results show that the combined intelligent algorithm has good performance in search.","","0-7803-8273-0","10.1109/WCICA.2004.1343114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1343114","","Product design;Humans;Computational modeling;Convergence;Design engineering;Genetics;Machine intelligence;Chaos;Sun;Marine technology","","","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research delved into the potential of Project-Based Learning (PBL), with a particular emphasis on the VBA Physics Simulation, to invigorate students’ learning engagement. By surveying undergraduate students’ perceptions in computational physics course, we observed a predominant positive response towards the PBL model. The findings underscore that students not only appreciate the structured learning experience PBL offers but also value the guidance from lecturers in this approach. Through the lens of PBL, students reported a marked improvement in various skills, including the 4C skills (Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity), problem-solving, and higher-order thinking skills. This study advocates for the broader integration of PBL in computational physics course, especially using tools like VBA Physics Simulation, as a means to deepen understanding and amplify student engagement. We also recommend future quantitative research to further solidify these findings.","2770-159X","979-8-3503-0596-8","10.1109/CITSM60085.2023.10455497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10455497","VBA Physics Simulation;Student Engagement;Project-Based Learning Models;Physics Education;Learning Outcomes;Project-Based Learning;Computational Physics","Art;Statistical analysis;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Physics education;Problem-solving;Physics","","","","32","IEEE","7 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Impact of Programming Exposure on the Development of Computational Thinking Capabilities: An Empirical Study","C. Cachero; P. Barra; S. Meliá; O.

As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987254","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness (Access@City)(grant numbers:TIN2016-78103-C2-2-R); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities(grant numbers:RTI2018-098156-B-C54); Co-Financed by FEDER funds (MINECO/ FEDER/UE); EduTech Project; Erasmus+Programme of the European Union(grant numbers:609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063433","Programming;computational thinking;problem-solving;career development;technology social factors;observational study","Programming profession;Training;Instruments;Psychology;Information systems;Problem-solving","","23","","39","CCBY","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578701","sorting algorithm;computational thinking;game-based learning activities;unplugged computing","Conferences;Games;Writing;Programming;Pattern recognition;Task analysis;Information technology","","","","13","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10380594","Instructional design;support vector machine;K-means clustering;innovative thinking;instructional system","Clustering algorithms;Support vector machines;Programming profession;Programming;Kernel;Classification algorithms;Educational technology","","3","","50","CCBYNCND","4 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking).
