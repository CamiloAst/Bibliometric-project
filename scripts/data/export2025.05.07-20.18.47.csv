"Interdisciplinary education in vocational education and training: Supporting joint up thinking — Some insites in lecturing","M. Grasser; F. Mayer","EUREGIO HTBLVA Ferlach, Ferlach, Austria; EUREGIO HTBLVA Ferlach, Ferlach, Austria",2015 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL),"5 Nov 2015","2015","","","615","619","The word “competence” is often used in association with education. It is thought that exercises with direct application of theoretical knowledge help students not only to deepen theoretical knowledge but also to awaken curiosity and to make the pupils go for learning. As competences imply the capability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, interdisciplinary education opens big opportunities not only to deepen the knowledge but also to ensure competent application of knowledge. Therefore, lecture projects have been performed in order to broaden and deepen interdisciplinary aspects in a vocational education and training college during the last five years. The topics involved have been computer-aided engineering, measuring and handcraft as well as different theoretical lectures in engineering. The outcome of the presented study is on the one hand a comparison of individual feedback of the involved students to the teacher with results of university research and on the other hand a discussion about observations based on a SWOT analysis, which summarizes the most important statements according to the performed lectures.","","978-1-4799-8707-8","10.1109/ICL.2015.7318098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318098","competences;vocational education and training;joint up thinking","Conferences;Training;Collaborative work;Computational modeling;Simulation;Games","","","","10","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the Grounded Theory, this research proposed a feasible supplemented method, extensible requirements elicitation and analysis process (XREAP), by emerging lateral thinking. The thinking level of the XREAP will cover the entire requirements scope as possible as it could. To verify this theoretical method, an experimental tool is implemented and utilized some systems to metric the differences between traditional and XREAP methods by the use case points approach. The XREAP can analyze requirements at the first step of the software development process, provide dimensional thinking to enhance the requirements analysis process, let the afterward development process trust the outcome of the requirements analysis phase, promotes the work efficiency and software quality undoubtedly, and significantly improves existing solutions.","","978-1-4673-2640-7","10.1109/CICSyN.2012.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274334","extensible markup interface;grounded theory;lateral thinking;requirements engineering;use case points","Unified modeling language;Software;Software engineering;Software metrics;Standards;Educational institutions;Google","","","","30","IEEE","23 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, UNEP has suggested localization prior to development, and harmonization, to aggregate impacts across spatial scales and across different taxonomic groups, applicable to all resources, to address emergent crosscutting issues across regions and models. This study posits that based on design thinking, sustainable investing/asset management theory needs to be situated within societal needs, to cater to differentiated needs, diverse capability maturity levels, and different flavours of reuse. Thus, instantiating from the Knowledge-Requirements Engineering frameworks, this study aims to review, simplify and localize sustainable investing concepts. To cater to different scenarios, a Knowledge-Requirements Engineering-Lifecycle Thinking-Innovation Helixes framework is proposed; intertwining expansive framing and UNEP's intrinsic value, pivoting via instrumental values, localized to cultural values, analogical to online shopping drivers, to enhance absorptive/ multiplicative/ relational capacity/capability, transformative innovations, across SDGs.

While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation. This article shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person exploring computer science PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. The findings from this study have implications for future directions in the CS education field, indicating that this model of online PD, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers’ confidence in adapting and delivering lessons designed to be engaging and accessible to all students.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2020.2989622","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:#1640117); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9076646","","Education;Handheld computers;Computer science;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Computer science education;Educational courses","","17","","12","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"On bounded rationality in cyber-physical systems security: Game-theoretic analysis with application to smart grid protection","A. Sanjab; W. Saad","Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US; Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA",2016 Joint Workshop on Cyber- Physical Security and Resilience in Smart Grids (CPSR-SG),"27 Oct 2016","2016","","","1","6","In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability.","","978-1-5090-1164-3","10.1109/CPSRSG.2016.7684101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7684101","","Security;Games;Smart grids;Cyber-physical systems;Nash equilibrium;Silicon;Computational modeling","","31","","22","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We utilize temporal data consisting of 3D joint positions, to construct a series of classifiers that can predict whether the subject appeared to possess reflective thinking ability during the given instance. We tackle the challenge of highly imbalanced data by incorporating and analyzing several meaningful data augmentation techniques and handcrafted features. We then feed different features through a number of machine learning classifiers and select the best performing model. We evaluate our predictions on multiple metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and MCC to work towards a generalized solution for the real-world dataset.","","978-1-6654-0021-3","10.1109/ACIIW52867.2021.9666442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666442","Handcrafted;Reflective Thinking;UMAP;ML","Measurement;Affective computing;Three-dimensional displays;Conferences;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Mathematics","","","","46","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A procedure for contemplation and comprehension by the machine-mind has been formalized. It uses: a) Z*-numbers for active-thought abstraction, b) multisensory data-structures to encapsulate objective and subjective real-time inputs, and transport these across framework-modules, and c) dynamic action-descriptor formulations for bespoke behavior, perception, and real-time attention modulation. The defined procedure acknowledges the machine-mind's interest in the subject being comprehended, and covers different levels of thinking (instinctive reactions to self-consciousness reasoning).
