This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.","","978-0-7381-2323-3","10.1109/ICAICT51780.2020.9333485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333485","Computational thinking;Cognitive Load;Electroencephalography (EEG);Theta/Beta;MATLAB GUI","Learning systems;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Graphical user interfaces;Matlab","","4","","12","IEEE","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Basic computer education in college should be promoted to information technology literacy education, which studentsâ€™ information technology literacy and practice ability will be strengthened. In this scheme, the teaching process is divided into three stages: basic information technology literacy education, application ability of information technology literacy education, information technology literacy of specialty education. And modularized courses are prepared for students in each stage. The detail of corresponding lecture and experiment curricula system is also researched.","","978-1-4244-3616-3","10.1109/ITME.2008.4743837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4743837","","Computer science education;Information technology;Educational institutions;Computer science;Educational technology;Hardware;Application software;History;Computer applications;Guidelines","","4","","6","IEEE","9 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper also presents a novel recursive algorithm for efficient computation of CLD for jump controlled structures and another algorithm to defeat the complexity induced due to high deletion rates.","","978-1-4244-7548-3","10.1109/CIT.2010.195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5578609","Linear finite state machine;Jump controlling;Edit distance attack;CLD computation","Clocks;Polynomials;Correlation;Indexes;Zinc;Conferences","","","","12","IEEE","16 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The creativity mechanisms in embodied agents: An explanatory model","J. Wiedermann","Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Human-like Intelligence (CIHLI),"30 Sep 2013","2013","","","41","47","In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.","","978-1-4673-5923-8","10.1109/CIHLI.2013.6613263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613263","","Mirrors;Computational modeling;Semantics;Pragmatics;Abstracts;Oceans;Syntactics","","3","","17","IEEE","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As in the leading sectors, in the world of education, rapid responses and immediate reactions to change significantly increase the ability to achieve and maintain success and thus marketability. As a sector responsible for developing the competences of individuals, building knowledge and training professionals, education should seek to keep pace with trends and break with traditional approaches and methods, so that, in addition to incorporating technological developments, a renewed approach to organizational development and methodology is an important means of achieving the desired success and effectiveness.

This growing of attention has led to numerous studies focusing on developing and improving models for SE. One of the persistent challenges in the area is in designing a lightweight model (in terms of memory and computation requirements) that still delivers satisfactory results in terms of sound quality. In this paper, we present a lightweight, DNN-based SE model that offers significantly less computations than the current state-of-the-art SE models. By following a step-by-step approach, we re-evaluate the impact of various parts of typical SE models revealing the trade-offs between speech quality and computational costs. Assuming a single-core, 200MHz microcontroller device, our SE model can achieve real-time SE performance (less than 3M Multiply-Accumulate operations, MACs) with a small degradation in SE capabilities compared to state-of-the-art SE models.","","979-8-3503-4983-2","10.1109/CCCI61916.2024.10736456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10736456","Noise reduction;deep neural networks;low power;microcontrollers;wearables","Performance evaluation;Microcontrollers;Computational modeling;Noise;Memory management;Focusing;Speech enhancement;Real-time systems;Telecommunication computing;Informatics","","","","36","IEEE","5 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
