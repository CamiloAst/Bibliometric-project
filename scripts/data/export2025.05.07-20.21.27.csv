"STEM-Coding using Drones","M. Roopaei; J. Horst",University of Wisconsin-Platteville; University of Wisconsin-Platteville,2021 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"29 Apr 2022","2021","","","140","145","STEM learning from an early age is essential to confirm that students are prepared to meet the needs of the world they will inherit. Currently, there are incredible and inexpensive technologies to keep students engaged and passionate about their learning. A drone is a handson apparatus that could be incorporated in STEM for several learning applications such as class projects, experiments, and exploration. In this paper, the STEMcoding framework is designed for kids to learn coding using a drone and Scratch programming. This platform attempts to visualize their coding by drone while Scratch makes a gaming environment to enhance their programming using block-based learning. The platform has applied in a STEM event at the University of Wisconsin Platteville and the results show the benefit of utilizing drone in STEM-coding as follows: i) transforms abstract concepts into concrete learning, ii) delivers an entertaining and motivating learning environment, iii) combines STEM theory with practice, and iv) provides a hand-on skill which is dynamic and attractive.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-1383-1","10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764109","Computational Thinking;Gamification;Drone Technology;Stem-Coding;Visualization.","Visualization;Conferences;Education;Transforms;Encoding;Concrete;Programming profession","","3","","34","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing methods assume that the texture of the entire image is domain-specific and irrelevant to class-specific representations. These methods enhance all regions with a single style, which can result in information loss. In this work, we propose CLAP (Cross-modality Local Augmentation for histoPathology), a data augmentation approach that enables cross-modality local manipulation for pathology images. Specifically, the combination of a text extractor network and a feature mapping network enables the integration of CLIP embeddings for style descriptions into editable latent spaces at a fine-grained level. This approach prevents the loss of regional information in whole-slide images, eliminates the need to painstakingly select directions in latent space, and enhances creativity style selection. Experimental results demonstrate that CLAP improves the regional accuracy of cross-modality editing and achieves state-of-the-art performance by enhancing generalization in histopathology classification tasks.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822842","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822842","style transfer;medical image data augmentation;cross-modality;local manipulation","Adaptation models;Accuracy;Histopathology;Feature extraction;Data augmentation;Computational efficiency;Bioinformatics;Creativity;Biomedical imaging","","","","7","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This exposes the tradeoff between profit level of network operators and network price of Edge Users (EUs), which is captivated by both the operators and EUs, and allows the operator to handle an optimal economic specification design. We consider the problem of maximum profit with minimum network price problem (MPP) as optimization problem, and present heuristics to obtain the upgrade series optimally. Preliminary outcome presents that the proposed model increases the profit level by 20 % and reduces network price by 30% compared to general edge and cloud platform.","","978-1-5386-5979-3","10.1109/INFCOMW.2018.8406828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8406828","","Computational modeling;Economics;Adaptation models;Mathematical model;Optimization;Cloud computing;Data models","","8","","5","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
