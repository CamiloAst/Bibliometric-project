"Computational Thinking Between Philosophy and STEM—Programming Decision Making Applied to the Behavior of “Moral Machines” in Ethical Values Classroom","A. M. Seoane Pardo","Research GRoup of InterAction and eLearning, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain",IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje,"22 Mar 2018","2018","13","1","20","29","This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines,"" using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.","1932-8540","","10.1109/RITA.2018.2809940","EU Erasmus + Programme through KA2 Project “TACCLE 3–Coding”(grant numbers:2015-1-BE02-KA201-012307); European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8305482","Computational thinking;decision making;game-based learning;ethics;logic;moral machines;self-driving car","Ethics;Europe;Decision making;Technological innovation;Training;Computer science","","11","","44","IEEE","1 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.","","978-1-6654-4306-7","10.1109/ICITEE53064.2021.9611850","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611850","Computational Thinking;Mixed Reality Technology;Game Development;Game-based Learning","Training;Three-dimensional displays;Mixed reality;Games;Virtual reality;Tools;Media","","5","","16","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration","2377-634X","978-1-61284-469-5","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142928","Computational thinking;Gerontechnology;Interdisciplinary;Teamwork","Gerontechnology;Teamwork;Computer science;Conferences;Computers","","5","","6","IEEE","2 Feb 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level.
