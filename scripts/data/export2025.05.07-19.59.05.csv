We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.","1093-9547","0-8186-8509-3","10.1109/IV.1998.694219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=694219","","Cognition;Psychology;Computer architecture;Couplings;Process design;Computational modeling;Buildings;Graphics","","","","8","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Can computational thinking reduce marginalization in the future Internet?","P. Wentworth","Department of Computer Science, Rhodes University, South Africa",2010 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Beyond the Internet? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services,"6 Jan 2011","2010","","","1","5","Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.","","978-1-4244-8272-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682137","Computational thinking;problem solving;abstraction;cognitive skills;marginalized communities","Games;Internet;Computer science;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Mathematics","","","","10","","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Video scenarios present problems in the context of lifelike settings in order to emphasize the complexity as well as creative potential presented by problems which are diverse, multi-layered and frequently ill-defined. Students must carefully observe and critically listen to the characters in the videos in order to understand the problems they are experiencing. Through discussion, design or implementation, students explore potential ways in which computing can be used to help the characters solve their problems. The approach is designed to develop creative problem solving skills, while also encouraging students to view themselves as capable of entrepreneurship and innovation in computing.

Facilitating computational thinking cannot only help students understand the professional knowledge and principles of computer, but also bring new ideas to addressing complex problems, therefore, many colleges and universities have carried out computer professional curriculum reform based on computational thinking. Due to the high degree of abstraction of computational thinking, traditional teaching methods will cause students to understand computational thinking only at the conceptual level, and cannot realize the flexible use of computational thinking concepts. This study takes the software engineering course as an example to explain how to integrate the concepts of computational thinking into the original courses. The goal is to enable students to understand software engineering contents problems from the perspective of problem-solving.","","978-1-7281-9146-1","10.1109/ICAICE51518.2020.00084","Beijing Union University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361128","Computational Thinking;Problem Solving;Software Engineering;Teaching Reform","Computer science;Software design;Education;Software;Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence;Software engineering","","1","","8","IEEE","1 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT includes three dimensions: CT concept, CT practice, and CT perspective. As a part of CT, the development of the CT perspective can promote the growth of students ‘ connection ability, questioning ability, and expression ability. CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity. The implementation of STEM + AI teaching helps students to internalize ideas from the perspective of CT, thus cultivating students' computational identity.","","979-8-3503-5180-4","10.1109/CSTE62025.2024.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589985","computational thinking perspective and identity;STEM + AI;teaching model","Computer science;Correlation;Computational modeling;Education;Artificial intelligence;Pupils;Standards","","","","16","IEEE","18 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to teaching the fundamentals of computational thinking, music programming, and logic, the course addresses the Four C’s of education. The change in students’ attitudes toward computer and algorithmic skills, creativity, communication, and collaboration is measured using a pre- and post-test experimental design. Additionally, computational thinking abilities are assessed through the administration of music analysis, procedural, graphical, and logic quizzes, while creativity is evaluated through a qualitative grading of the students’ final music projects. Results show a general perceived improvement of the students’ attitudes toward the Four C’s as well as a good ability to convert learned computational models into musical creativity. However, more effort is needed in order to guarantee an overall improvement in the students’ actual computational thinking abilities.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2023.3313394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10278231","Computational thinking;digital transformation;professional musical education;the Four C’s","Education;Programming profession;Music;Creativity;Production;Collaboration;Visualization","","2","","56","IEEE","11 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
