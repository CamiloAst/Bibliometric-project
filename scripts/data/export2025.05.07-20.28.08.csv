The country needs specialists with systems thinking, who can make informed decisions, who are able to think outside the box and modern, who are able to search for and use useful information, and learn innovative technologies. Internet technologies play an important role in solving these problems in the educational system. In particular, the implementation of priority projects has begun, which provide for the improvement of the e-government system, the development of the market for software products and information technologies, the organization of IT parks in all regions of the republic, and the provision of this area with qualified personnel. The article presents a model for organizing students’ independent work using online technologies.

However, studies show that this goal is yet to be achieved among African universities in terms of supervision due to inadequate availability of supervisors to their research students. Ambient learning approach promises to address the problem by allowing access to education services like research supervision at anytime, anywhere and anyhow. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted to assess its effectiveness towards achieving sustainable development goal four. The aim of this paper is to describe a model that illustrates how ambient learning systems can be combined with decision support tools to support evaluation of its effectiveness.","2640-0146","978-1-7281-1301-2","10.1109/ISCMI.2018.8703251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703251","ambient learning;artificial intelligence;decision support systems;computational thinking","Data mining;Tools;Learning systems;Task analysis;Engines;Computational modeling","","1","","13","IEEE","2 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper assigns these computational resources to guarantee a specified bound on response errors. We define the economical simulation problem (ESP) as designing the simulation of a stable linear system and distributing computational resources (wordlength) among the digital devices such that the computational cost (memory) is minimized without violating the required simulation accuracy. This problem is generally not convex because of the scaling constraint. By exploring the special structure of this joint optimization of the choice of the realizations and the computational resources to be applied, and under a scaling assumption, the ESP is converted to a convex problem. Numerical results are given which compare this method with existing approaches.","0191-2216","0-7803-7924-1","10.1109/CDC.2003.1272420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1272420","","Computational modeling;Electrostatic precipitators;Hardware;Digital simulation;Linear systems;Distributed computing;Computational efficiency;Large-scale systems;Aerospace engineering;Aerodynamics","","","","8","IEEE","15 Mar 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Which can help students enhance computational thinking, design thinking, and programming skills in python language. Through teaching practices, the effectiveness and feasibility of this education model are demonstrated when compared to traditional teaching methods.

VC is generally a noninteractive process for those contributing computing resources to a project, whereas volunteer thinking (VT) or distributed thinking allows volunteers to participate interactively in CCS projects to solve human computation tasks. In this paper, we describe the integration of three tools, the Virtual Atom Smasher (VAS) game developed by CERN, LiveQ, a job distribution middleware, and CitizenGrid, an online platform for hosting and providing computation to CCS projects. This integration demonstrates the combining of VC and VT to help address the scientific and educational goals of games like VAS.
