"Educational Robotics and Computer Programming in Early Childhood Education: A Conceptual Framework for Assessing Elementary School Students’ Computational Thinking for Designing Powerful Educational Scenarios","A. Alam","Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, India",2022 International Conference on Smart Technologies and Systems for Next Generation Computing (ICSTSN),"25 Apr 2022","2022","","","1","7","The researcher sought to synthesize data from studies on robotics programming experiences for children in the age bracket zero to eight, as well as for pre- and in-service early childhood educators, to identify possible contributions that robotics programming may make to teaching and learning of STEM (sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. The investigation was initiated with inclusion of research articles as a result of search and assessment processes. All of these studies were selected such that they had the application of educational robotics in common. The synthesis of preliminary findings, study subjects, and potential advantages of educational robots in STEM education, especially in engineering and technology are discussed and dealt with in great detail. Additionally, the implications of educational robotics and robotics programming for educational institutions, curricular materials, and pedagogical techniques are incisively addressed. This review revealed that employing robots to teach computer programming may be a promising teaching tool for early childhood STEM education.","","978-1-6654-2111-9","10.1109/ICSTSN53084.2022.9761354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761354","Engineering;Robotics;Pedagogical Science;e-Learning;Computer Programming;Educational Technology;STEM Education;Early Childhood Education","Systematics;Educational robots;Education;Toy manufacturing industry;Educational technology;Robots;Programming profession","","45","","16","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we explore the reform on this course for two goals. One is to redesign the teaching content: from operation oriented to computational thinking oriented. Computational thinking is one of the most important ability for 21st century and has become the primary goal of computer foundation education. New content covers the basic principles of computer science as well as the fundamental ways of thinking and problem solving with computer. The second goal is to improve teaching methods by leveraging mobile technology. We propose the use of MIT App Inventor, which is a simple tool for creating mobile applications for Android. Students with no prior knowledge of programming can create entertaining and socially useful applications with App Inventor while practicing computational thinking.","","978-1-5090-2218-2","10.1109/ICCSE.2016.7581699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7581699","App Inventor;computational thinking;fundamentals of Computer;mobile computing","Computers;Programming;Education;Problem-solving;Mobile applications;Databases","","2","","12","IEEE","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Employing narratives to trigger interest in computational activities with inner-city girls","S. Erete; N. Pinkard; C. K. Martin; J. Sandherr","College of Computing and Digital Media, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA; College of Computing and Digital Media, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA; Digital Youth Network, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA; Digital Youth Network, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA","2015 Research in Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT)","12 Oct 2015","2015","","","1","1","There has been a well-documented and persistent drop in the number of women in computer science and engineering courses [1]. Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.","","978-1-5090-0151-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296518","","Physics;Statistics;Sociology;Computational modeling;User experience;Training;Textiles","","6","","","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper continues a long-term study that began in 2007 and focuses on student confidence with the use of computational tools. On the first day of class, students were surveyed on their proficiency with the use of spreadsheets. Students self reported levels of proficiency from expert to no experience. Students were then asked a simple question regarding a spreadsheet cell equation. Over three years only 16% of the students were correct, while 90% self ranked as familiar or better. A gender bias was noted as women under estimated their skills while men overestimated their own abilities. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge of gender confidence gaps. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for creating an assessment plan to identify the preparedness of incoming students and measure their skill at the end of the course.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-6262-9","10.1109/FIE.2010.5673354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673354","assessment;first year;gender confidence","Engineering students;Computers;Educational institutions;Conferences;Mechanical engineering;Videos;Software","","2","","6","IEEE","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are various types of models and contexts in which they are applied. Generalized research on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom is emerging, and results have been mixed. One such model is team-based learning (TBL) as originally developed by Larry Michaelsen in the late 1970s. TBL is a structured way to implement a flipped classroom approach, and has been shown to be successful in achieving deeper learning among the students. In this paper, we discuss our experience using the TBL methodology in a graduate computer engineering course on system level design of embedded systems. Specifically, we describe the course design, instructor experience adapting TBL for use in the course, including implementing an asynchronous online TBL process, and instructor reflections and student feedback on what worked well and what did not. We analyze the course content using the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, and assess the effectiveness of our implementation in achieving deeper learning. Additionally, we report on student perception of the new course structure and their experience using TBL.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344227","engineering education;team-based learning;online learning;asynchronous teaming;embedded systems","Education;Embedded systems;Computational modeling;Online services;Computers;System-level design","","6","","38","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
