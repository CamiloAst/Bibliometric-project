Engineering design has been mainly developed for electromechanical artifacts. In practice, this has meant that the scientific knowledge required for creating technical artifacts such as engines, cars, ships, cranes, telephones, radios, TVs, and simple data processing units has been natural science. However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI. To grasp intelligent information processing, we need concepts and approaches suited for the task. To create intelligent technologies on this basis, we need concepts and approaches that afford the operationalization of such information in artificial systems. We suggest that psychology of thinking and cognitive modeling provide a logical basis for future AI design.","","978-1-7281-9951-1","10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9573882","Business Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573882","AI;Artificial Intelligence;Psychology of Thinking;Design Methods;Cognitive Models;Engineering Design;Computer Science","Industries;TV;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems;Psychology;Information processing;Telephone sets","","1","","27","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While unauthorized access and unethical actions by intruders remain a cause of concern, ensuring the right measures through proper Threat Modelling techniques is necessary to create a barrier against them. The intention of getting access to a system or website or server can be born out of multiple threat groups and can be classified into common security threats. This paper looks at a persona-based approach to identify user groups that can be a threat to a system and how we can use the concepts of Design Thinking to model the system and protect it from possible security breaches. Considering the agile methodologies of software development, the paper talks about focusing on a perspective that discusses a design methodology by keeping the individuals and interactions for working models at the top of threat modelling measures.","2573-3079","978-1-7281-7132-6","10.1109/PDGC50313.2020.9315844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9315844","Threat Modelling;Design Thinking;Agile Methodologies;Security;Information Systems;Scrum","Security;Computational modeling;Software measurement;Planning;Handheld computers;Grid computing;Focusing","","9","","18","IEEE","15 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637221","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1640228); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637221","computational thinking;STEM+C;Project Based Learning;teacher perspectives","Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Computational modeling;Data collection;Data models;Problem-solving;STEM","","2","","22","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT.

Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620553","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1657002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620553","Equity and inclusion in computing;Computational thinking;Transdisciplinary (CT+X) curriculum models","Computer science;Electric potential;Systematics;Computational modeling;Affordances;Tools;Inspection","","1","","46","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including ""communities"" of tools, ""modeling simulations,"" ""problem-solving"" and ""scaffolding"" of learning strategies, ""demographic attributes"" of factors, ""practices"" and ""perspectives"" of the knowledge-based areas, and the ""teacher training"" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term ""unplugged"" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews.

The concept of computational thinking is almost needed on every profession in the computerization of society. Teaching computational thinking to cultivate problem solving ability by computer is a challenge of computer science education, especially for the K-12 level. Although studies introduce computational concepts by programming design, computational thinking and computer science are not computer programming. The study uses social simulation content (i.e. NetLogo, which uses muti-agent technology) to scaffold learning computational thinking concepts, such as simple genetic algorithm, parallel computing, artificial neural net, or deadlock (such as dining philosophers). To stimulate learning transfer onto computational thinking, NetLogo models library will be used to motivate reflection and meta-cognition development. Preliminary experimental results came from both questionnaires and artifacts. In the future, Gero's (1990) function-behaviour-structure (FBS) ontology will be used for the qualitative analysis to explain the outcomes of learning transfer.","","978-89-88678-47-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016643","","Computational modeling;Object oriented modeling;Brain modeling;Programming profession;Biological system modeling;Computer languages","","","","16","","12 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
