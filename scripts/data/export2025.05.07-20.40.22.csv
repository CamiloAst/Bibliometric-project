Prototyping is moving to virtual by the application of sophisticated product models for complex simulations. Simulations rely upon knowledge representing experience, expertise and intelligence of engineers in knowledge wares. Increasing proportion of this knowledge is placed in the product model in the form of active rules, checks, and reactions. In case of any change of these knowledge representations, relevant product model entities are modified accordingly. This knowledge must be verified by practice. Consequently, interaction of virtual and physical worlds is anticipated as a main area for future research in product model based virtual engineering systems. The authors developed and published a novel knowledge based method for the definition of product objects during the recent years. In this paper, they conceptualize a possible integration of intelligent sensor networks with active knowledge in product models. They propose introduction of physical information space in order to receive engineering object related information from preprocessed sensor data. The proposed novel method is based on intelligent capabilities both in sensor and product modeling.","","978-1-4577-1402-3","10.1109/WISP.2011.6051722","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051722","","Humans;Knowledge engineering;Data models;Adaptation models;Process control;Computational modeling;Context","","","","12","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This course focuses on discussing the linear theory of finite dimensional space, which is highly logical and abstract. Examination is an important way and means to urge students to study consciously and check the effects of teaching and learning. It is also an effective guiding measure for learning behavior, and it is also a method often used to distinguish, discover and select talents. It is an important measure to integrate the idea of mathematical modeling into the reform of mathematics teaching in colleges and universities. Based on the idea of mathematical modeling, this paper calculates the assessment parameters by MCMC method, and realizes the accurate test of online learning achievement. Experimental results show that user satisfaction and performance are high.","","978-1-7281-9018-1","10.1109/IPEC51340.2021.9421096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9421096","Mathematical modelling;Linear algebra;Intelligent on-line test system","Geometry;Computers;Analytical models;Image processing;Conferences;Computational modeling;Education","","","","8","IEEE","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our intent is threefold: 1) adapting the new humanities and social sciences to the undergraduate training requirements of applied higher education institutions. 2) combining course characteristics, teaching processes and teaching objectives, and 3) developing a smart teaching model for the curriculum that use “Chaoxing Xuexitong” intelligent terminals. Because successful implementation requires both leadership from teachers and a collaborative effort from students, we review the development process of online teaching to identify the advantages of online teaching platform construction. We also consider how teaching organization and information, and the design perspective can be optimized using the Chaoxing classroom teaching platform. This mode of delivery yields benefits via the optimization of teaching effectiveness while providing a model that can be used to explore intelligent teaching of information technology in exhibition design courses.","","979-8-3503-2903-2","10.1109/CEDL60560.2023.00032","Anhui University; Anhui Provincial Quality Engineering Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10337505","Information Technology;Web-based Teaching;B-Learning","Training;Leadership;Computer aided instruction;Distance learning;Computational modeling;Education;Social sciences","","","","5","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contextual connections are applied to define corporate knowledge features as relationships amongst product object parameters. Current product models include comprehensive range of contextual features. However, current user interfaces for product definition processes are not in the possession of capabilities for the required human-computer communication and model representation. Coordination of human originated intent and engineering objective definitions for product feature definitions is not available. The authors of this paper introduced a new contextual chain in which human intent, product behavior, and adaptive action objects are connected in order to establish modeling capabilities for the above communication, representation, and coordination. As a realization of this method, new sets of entities were defined to extend currently applied product model entity sets. This paper starts with characterizing and evaluation of the currently prevailing product modeling. Following this, a new model and its entities are introduced and the method of extension of current model with this model is explained. Implementation of the proposed method is facilitated by the possibility for new object class definition by using of open surface of current industrial product modeling systems.","","978-1-4244-7430-1","10.1109/SAMI.2011.5738860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738860","","Humans;Context modeling;Data models;Aerospace electronics;Computational modeling;Adaptation model;Knowledge representation","","","","13","IEEE","24 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students in these courses can have varying degrees of prior exposure to computational tools and often exhibit a wide range of intrinsic motivation for learning these skills. Interviews with first-year engineering students were conducted to study the degree to which motivation correlated with intended major within engineering. The pilot round of interviews was conducted in the spring of 2021. This pilot study used the same data set of 8 interviews to progressively refine both the survey and interview collection in the 2021 – 2022 academic year. This paper will review the results of the pilot study and detail the process used to develop and use the finalized protocol and coding schemes for a planned series of 20 interviews in Summer 2022. While this technique developed because of limited data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been beneficial to the researcher and may provide guidance for future researchers.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962433","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962433","Self efficacy;utility value;interviews;computational thinking;first year","COVID-19;Protocols;Pandemics;Data collection;Encoding;Interviews;Springs","","","","12","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
