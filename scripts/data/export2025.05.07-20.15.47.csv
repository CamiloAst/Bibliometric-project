One goal of higher education is to develop students' critical thinking and research skills. Prior work suggests these skills are best taught explicitly, when they are embedded in the curriculum, using active learning strategies, and using recent high-quality research as a basis for inquiry. Using multiple methods, this paper examines how teaching critical academic literacy skills through active learning strategies impacts student critical thinking ability and engagement. Results suggest substantial student engagement and improvements in critical literacy skills.","2470-6698","978-1-5386-6522-0","10.1109/TALE.2018.8615196","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615196","active learning;blended classroom;critical thinking;critical academic literacy;master's level;computer architecture;computer science education;student engagement","Education;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computational modeling;Australia;Conferences;Prefetching","","4","","14","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program. This study presents a practical method for improving design innovation capability, and supports the feasibility and necessity of emphasizing computational thinking and sustainability in the innovation training program for engineering education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019290","Opening Foundation of Key Laboratory Energy Monitoring and Edge Computing of for Smart City of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019TP1017); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177007","Design innovation;computational thinking;conceptualization of sustainability;engineering education","Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Sustainable development;Creativity;Training;Task analysis","","7","","50","CCBY","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CT is closely related to problem solving and critical thinking, which are actively used in STEM education. Research on CT has gained steady momentum recently, and many of the institutions around the world have adopted CT into their curriculum. This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools. Hence, we plan to analyze the existing assessment methods and propose a new sophisticated tool for evaluating CT skills as our future work.","","978-1-6654-0467-9","10.1109/ICITIIT51526.2021.9399606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399606","computational thinking;problem solving;intervention;assessment;programming","Visualization;Bibliographies;Conferences;Virtual reality;Tools;Problem-solving;Programming profession","","5","","96","IEEE","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We challenge the current view of simulation, to the extent that most textbooks' contents will be found to be secondary to the missing necessary primary material. We advocate that (simulation) education has four general objectives, which are to teach students how to learn, how to think creatively, how to problem solve, and how to be professionals. These four objectives of education may not be possible to teach. In the words of Oscar Wilde, ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught"". So an education in simulation requires that students be put into learning situations that enable them to learn the requisite knowledge concerning the four objectives.","","0-7803-8131-9","10.1109/WSC.2003.1261662","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1261662","","Books;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Art;Sections;Information systems;Education;Contracts;Ethics","","3","","3","IEEE","30 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Higher test score doesn't represent better global competitiveness. Creativity is central to the competitive capabilities of 21st century citizens and thus creativity education should play crucial role for every grade curricular. However, the development of creative potential requires work and incubation over time. It takes more efforts than standard curricula can afford. What role can e-learning strategy with focus on science and technology have in sparking innovation? Such e-learning strategy can be the digital storybooks which convey science histories or technology innovation stories with domain knowledge, creative and critical thinking, and problem solving--the basic ingredients of creativity and innovation. Learning occurs within a real world of our daily life. The connections between learners' script memory and contextual learning materials have a positive impact on meaningful learning. Therefore, histories of scientific findings as well as technology innovations would benefit science education especially for elementary pupils. However, there are a few story-based learning materials for primary science curricula. This study design and develop a digital storybook based upon true story of Taiwan young inventors. The process of problem awareness, situation perception, idea generation, solution emergence and selection as well as action preparations are elaborated in the story. Pilot testing of target users show a strong positive attitude toward this digital storybook.","","978-1-4244-7255-0","10.1109/ITAP.2011.6006334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6006334","","Technological innovation;History;Electronic learning;Presses;Computational modeling;Materials","","","","18","IEEE","29 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The formation of this kind of competences cannot be ensured by purely theoretical training; therefore, it is proposed to use models of optimal environmental management as vivid examples of solving optimization problems. The models illustrate such basic optimization concepts as the objective functional, different kinds of constraints, and the formulation of nonlinear and dynamic programming problems. Using the examples of managing the process of forest restoration, the importance of the correct selection of parameters of the model and methods for solving the optimization problem is shown. Concrete examples of using the proposed technique are given.","","978-1-6654-4396-8","10.1109/TELE52840.2021.9482561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9482561","optimisation problems;didactics of higher education;optimal control;nature management;forest restoration;mathematical modelling","Training;Computational modeling;Avatars;Decision making;Optimal control;Tools;Task analysis","","","","36","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It not only provides new sources of inspiration for artistic creation, but also makes the constraints of visual communication design more complex. At the same time, media convergence has promoted a strong demand for cross media conversion and diversified output, especially in the process of brand visual innovation, where more and more multimedia elements, dynamic effects, and interactive needs are emerging. Traditional visual design methods are insufficient in this complex design environment, and there is an urgent need to innovate design patterns through new technologies and strategies. Since the concept of ""computational design"" was proposed, algorithms and programming techniques have gradually become the core tools of modern visual design. Through extensive practice, computational design has not only brought rich changes to brand visual forms, but also developed into a systematic design pattern that can respond to the diversity and dynamism of today's design needs. This study explores the structure and development of computational visual design systems, with a focus on analyzing their potential applications and practical strategies in new retail pet brands. Through in-depth market research, the application opportunities of computational design in brand vision have been revealed, and algorithm based brand vision construction strategies, brand image communication strategies, and community driven visual communication strategies have been proposed. Finally, by combining the actual design case of the ""Xiaopei Pet"" brand, the effectiveness of these strategies was verified, providing new ideas for innovation in the field of brand visual design and valuable experience for the future development of computational visual design.","2473-5655","979-8-3315-3193-5","10.1109/CSNT64827.2025.10968145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10968145","Computational design;Brand Vision;Pet brand;New Retail","Visualization;Technological innovation;Visual communication;Diversity reception;Collaboration;Media;Market research;Mathematical models;Artificial intelligence;Visual perception","","","","10","IEEE","23 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
