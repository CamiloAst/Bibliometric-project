The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028360","problem solving;computational thinking;computer science education;reflection","Problem-solving;Reflection;Computer science;Industries;Education;Interviews;US Government","","","","12","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Roles of Code in Computational Science","K.

But even though we write--and use--more and more code, we rarely think about the roles that this code will have in our research, in our publications, and ultimately in the scientific record. In this article, the author outlines some frequent roles of code in computational science. These roles aren't exclusive; in fact, it's common for a piece of code to have several roles, at the same time or as an evolution over time. Thinking about these roles, ideally before starting to write the code, is a good habit to develop.","1558-366X","","10.1109/MCSE.2017.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7802531","code;best practices;programming;scientific computing","Software;Libraries;Computer languages;Context;Writing;Programming;Computers","","1","","3","IEEE","30 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.","","978-1-7281-2547-3","10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308494","Ministry of Human Resource Development; Jadavpur University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308494","insight;creativity;EEG;spectrogram;capsule network","Electroencephalography;Creativity;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Feature extraction;Information filters;Convolution","","1","","41","IEEE","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Modding communities are active, digital distribution systems are essential, and hardware can be customized. Future developments in gaming, such as virtual reality, cloud gaming, and artificial intelligence, portend more innovation in the industry. The game, Plants vs Zombies is represented by Finite Automata and it is ruled by DFAs and NFAs which describe the actions and behaviours of both the plants and the zombies and the result of their actions. In the proposed work you can notice how the NFA will be converted to DFA and vice versa due to its handy functions. Overall, ""Plants vs Zombies"" is a fun and interactive way for players to explore computational thinking while learning about the complex ideas of NFA and DFA in Automata Theory. The advantages are Synchronize State Management, Consistent State Transitions, Easier Development, and Unambiguous Animation Staging.","","979-8-3503-6456-9","10.1109/NKCon62728.2024.10775099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10775099","Finite Automata;Computational Thinking;Automata Theory;Plants vs Zombie and Interactive Gaming","Video games;Technological innovation;Solid modeling;Analytical models;Systematics;Learning automata;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Games;Virtual reality","","","","16","IEEE","10 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded. Following this, process for the definition of coordinated product behaviors and affect propagation in a specific and purposeful change affect zone are explained. Finally, an extended product definition space is explained as medium in integrated product modeling using the proposed method.","","978-1-4244-9109-4","10.1109/SACI.2011.5873053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5873053","","Humans;Industries;Aerospace electronics;Data models;Knowledge engineering;Informatics;Adaptation model","","2","","10","IEEE","9 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
