Vice versa, it helps students organize and build up new knowledge around the core CS concepts they encounter on the daily basis. Furthermore, CT provides a set of problem-solving skills and enhances analytical abilities that are crucial for the young generation to succeed in modern world pervaded with technology. Teaching the principles of computing to students with non-computing tracks of study provides them with a competitive advantage and breaks down stereotypes around CS. Our approach is to introduce a topic related to world issues and students' interests while concealing its relation to CS until students' interest and attention are captured. The approach takes advantage of pattern-matching abilities that are naturally wired in our brain to improve understanding and make the obtained knowledge persist in memory. The paper discusses some of the modules developed as part of the Inspire-CT project that can be delivered in one or part of a class period at high school or middle school.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-1352-0","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462487","computational thinking;Fault Tree Analysis","Educational institutions;Fault trees;Logic gates;Computers;Chemistry;Reliability;Software","","9","","2","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Game-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning are two approaches that may aid in the development of CT skills. This paper describes a framework based on Game and Collaborative Learning which aims to enhance the CT teaching that improves students' social skills in a fun way. The framework stands out by including collaborative learning features defined in the main literature. Also, the strategy was developed specifically to fit the games' dynamics. The approach was evaluated via metacognitive and transactive analysis and by a survey. The results showed evidence that the method is able to stimulate interaction among students to apply problem-solving strategies.","2375-141X","978-1-7281-4752-9","10.1109/ICVRV47840.2019.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212993","Game Based Learning;Collaborative Learning;Computational Thinking","Games;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Programming;Problem-solving;Education;Cognition","","6","","11","IEEE","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The premise of integrating CT with other subjects is to promote school teachers with high self-efficacy in CT. Towards this, we developed a three-week Scratch online professional development(PD) course based on MIT CT framework, then implemented an online training among 84 primary and secondary school teachers from different subjects including Chinese, Mathematics, English, and Computer Science. To examine the effect of its impact on teachers' self-efficacy in CT, a quasi-experiment method of a single group pretest-posttest was conducted, and quantitative and qualitative data were collected from scales, artifacts, and interviews. The results revealed that the online PD course significantly improved teaching self-efficacy in CT of these teachers. The findings indicated that online PD integrated with MIT CT framework through block-based programming was a potential approach to effectively promote teaching self-efficacy in CT for primary and secondary school teachers.","2166-0549","978-1-7281-9171-3","10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00048","Ministry of Education; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320743","Computational Thinking;teacher professional development;Scratch;teaching self-efficacy","Education;Training;Handheld computers;Programming profession;Tools;Parallel processing;Games","","5","","27","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many initiatives have emerged to promote early development of CT skills. However, to date, there are no studies in which CT is developed in minority groups, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a Game Design Workshop aimed at teenagers with Autism Spectrum Disorders. An analysis of the artifacts produced by the participants of a pilot offering of the workshop was performed using a rubric for CT skills acquisition. The results showed that the participants, all of them with high-functioning autism and no previous experience with programming, acquired intermediate level skills related to CT.","","978-9-8998-4346-2","10.1109/CISTI.2016.7521416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521416","autism spectrum disorders;computational thinking;digital games;scratch","Games;Conferences;Autism;Sprites (computer);Computed tomography;Programming;Buildings","","5","","11","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We integrated CT with existing curriculum alongside programming and teaching general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning. Our aim here is not only to teach a programming language per se, but also to teach, at the beginning, the different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A positive learning experience is successfully developed for our students by using appropriate pedagogies and strategies. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey as well as a pre- and post-CT test were conducted on student cohort in different sections. The statistical analysis of the survey and test results show evidence of improvement in student's problem solving and coding skills as well as increase in motivation towards programming.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273930","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273930","Introductory Programming;Computational Thinking;Visual Learning;Dynamic Classroom;Retention","Programming profession;Education;Visualization;Syntactics;Python;Problem-solving;Flowcharts","","4","","20","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, monitoring the learning progress of students is still a hurdle to teachers and researchers. In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games. Also, it could be identified that students of both educational levels reached similar levels of CT skill development.","","978-1-5386-3057-0","10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8226407","Self Organizing Map;Computational Thinking;Digital Games","Digital TV","","2","","","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Initiatives seeking to increase access to CS have led to an increase in elementary schools teaching computational thinking (CT), but students are often instructed by classroom teachers who have no formal training in CT or CS. Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS. Our findings suggest teachers would benefit from explicit support to provide opportunities for students currently underrepresented in CS and to offer more equitable opportunities to students regardless of their CS background.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272488","computational thinking;professional development;equity;computer science education;science education","Education;Encoding;Tools;Programming profession;Statistics;Sociology;Production","","2","","8","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
