Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274065","computational thinking;reading and writing skills;game design;unplugged","Games;Production;Writing;Education;Computers;Tools;Mathematics","","4","","61","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created.

Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies. We believe that these findings may help recognize which constructs and abilities underline CT, primarily algorithmic thinking without programming activities.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637151","","Cognitive processes;Conferences;Pattern recognition;Task analysis;Programming profession","","3","","27","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are currently primarily used in teaching computer science and STEM subjects but can be applied to all subjects and in all life situations. The paper presents the need to develop computational thinking in various subjects of primary education, with particular emphasis on combining digital (""plugged"") and non-digital (""unplugged"") activities, as well as on the development of algorithmic thinking.

This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries. The program has helped to promote the much needed awareness of using STEM based solutions to solve global challenges through a multi-disciplinary collaborative approach involving students and faculty from mathematical sciences and engineering who continue to collaborate.","","978-1-5090-5379-7","10.1109/ISECon.2017.7910238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7910238","Design Thinking;Interdisciplinary;Mathematical Modeling;Global STEM Outreach","Drones;Conferences;Stakeholders;Animals;Collaboration;STEM;Computational modeling","","2","","9","USGov","27 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contemporary teaching should prepare learners for everyday and working life, suggesting that this can only be achieved by implementing Digital Education from primary education onwards. Since computer science education is planned to be anchored in the Austrian primary school curriculum as an interdisciplinary competence development, research into teaching methods and content suitable for this area is becoming increasingly necessary. In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling. Hence, the development of the learning environment and the didactic approach gained from qualitative results of interviews and observations from the first cycle of the research project are presented, providing plausible arguments for further implementing this robotics-based learning environment.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637351","computational thinking;educational robotics;digital storytelling;primary school","Computer science;Technological innovation;Conferences;Education;Encoding;Computer science education;Problem-solving","","6","","33","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
