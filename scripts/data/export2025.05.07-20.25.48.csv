With the development of visual programming languages such as Scratch, this movement has emerged again in recent years, as teachers at all educational levels and from different disciplines consider that the use of programming enhances learning in many subjects and allows students to develop important skills. The systematic literature review presented in this article aims to summarize the results of recent research using programming with Scratch in subjects not related to computing and communications, as well as studies analyzing the kind of skills students develop while learning to code in this environment. Although the analyzed papers provide promising results regarding the use of programming as an educational resource, this review highlights the need to conduct more empirical research in classrooms, using larger samples of students that allow to obtain clear conclusions about the types of learning that could be enhanced through programming.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-8633-3","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474546","Computational thinking;Scratch;Systematic Literature Review;Learning","Programming profession;Bibliographies;Mathematics;Systematics;Encoding;Computer languages","","33","","35","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.","","978-1-4577-0142-9","10.1109/ICCSA.2011.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5959566","CAS;KETpic;metacognition;symbolic thinking;modularization of mathematical operations;Scilab","Materials;Graphics;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Three dimensional displays;Writing;Mathematical model","","1","","8","IEEE","21 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art CC frameworks.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2019.2895860","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61873095,61772569,61873097,U1701267); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2014B050504005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8628260","Cooperative coevolution (CC);dynamic grouping (DyG) strategy;large scale global optimization (LSGO);nonseparable problems","Optimization;Benchmark testing;Computational efficiency;Estimation;Dimensionality reduction;Evolutionary computation;Computer science","","40","","49","IEEE","27 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.

Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757676","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757676","pattern recognition;pattern generalization;computer education;computing;computational thinking;STEM","Pattern recognition;Education;Systematics;Databases;Computers;Mathematics;Standards","","3","","9","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This problem becomes two-fold for mesoscale weather models that operate in near-real-time at cloud-scale resolution. For example, typical approaches to vector field visualization (e.g., wind) are based upon global methods, which may not illustrate detailed structure. In addition, such computations employ multi-resolution meshes to capture small-scale phenomena, which are not properly reflected in both vector and scalar realizations. To address the former critical point analysis and simple bandpass filtering of wind fields is employed for better seed point identification of streamline calculations. For the latter, an encapsulation of nested computational meshes is developed for general realization. It is then combined with the seed point calculation for an improved vector visualization of multi-resolution weather forecasting data.","","0-7803-6478-3","10.1109/VISUAL.2000.885745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885745","","Data visualization;Computational modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Grid computing;Wind;Weather forecasting;Multiresolution analysis;Application software;Predictive models;Animation","","11","3","10","IEEE","4 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
