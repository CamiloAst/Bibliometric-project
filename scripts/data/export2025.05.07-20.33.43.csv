This article is based on the power supply service scenario, and proposes a large model intelligent question answering method that can be applied to special scenarios of power supply services, based on CoT and RAG. The method is divided into three stages: problem recognition and rewriting, precise text fragment extraction, and standard answer generation. The open source model Qwen2-72B is used to achieve 98.05% correct reference file recall and 85.12% accurate answer rate through keyword recognition, high-quality rewriting, and rough recall and rearrangement of reference text.","","979-8-3315-2171-4","10.1109/ACTCE65085.2024.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10873120","large models;CoT;RAG;power supply services","Seminars;Control engineering;Power supplies;Text recognition;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Transformers;Question answering (information retrieval);Artificial intelligence;Standards","","","","9","IEEE","14 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This project intends to study the EEG - computer interaction model based on facial expression. A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.","","979-8-3503-8098-9","10.1109/EEBDA60612.2024.10485933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485933","Brain-computer interface;electroencephalogram;neural network;feature extraction","Emotion recognition;Computational modeling;Simulation;Neural networks;Brain modeling;Wavelet analysis;Electroencephalography","","","","9","IEEE","8 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end-users. More recent approaches include visual programming with a drag-and-drop style of programming that makes it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Conversational Programming, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to help end-users visualize discrepancies between the programs they intended to write and their actual programming results.","1943-6106","978-1-4577-1247-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6070398","Game design;computational thinking;debugging;end-user programming;visual programming","Programming profession;Visualization;Games;Semantics;Fires;Green products","","9","","22","IEEE","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The UML diagrams lack with defining semantics of the functionality of a system to be developed. Automata theory and formal methods are proved powerful at requirement specification, modeling, design and test case generation. To address and realize the benefits of liking UML, automata and formal methods, our project on ""formalization of UML diagrams"" is in progress. This paper is continuation of the same project in which behavior diagrams namely use case, activity and state diagrams are selected for critical analysis and possible improvements. Advantages, disadvantages and limitations of the diagrams are addressed. Finally, a treatment is suggested to link UML diagrams with nondeterministic and parallel finite automata to enhance modeling power of UML for facilitating the software development procedures.","","978-1-4799-3010-4","10.1109/CSCI.2014.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822324","UML;Use cases;Activity diagram;State diagram;Automata","Unified modeling language;Automata;Object oriented modeling;Software engineering;Semantics;Computational modeling;Computers","","5","","49","IEEE","29 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By working with teachers on how to assimilate programming and computational thinking into their classrooms we will effectively reach a large population of students in areas where computer science classes are not available. In this paper, we outline the current state of the project and some of the data we have collected. Future goals for this project include performing a rigorous evaluation of teacher impact and developing the workshop materials for wider dissemination.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-1352-0","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462477","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462477","outreach;professional development;computational thinking","Conferences;Educational institutions;Programming profession;Java","","4","","4","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To bridge this gap, this study validated the existing Elementary Student Coding Attitudes Survey (ESCAS) in Chinese context and use the scale to explore how students perceived coding. Also, the association between coding attitude and CT performance was investigated. A total of 217 elementary students were involved. Psychometric qualities of ESCAS (Chinese) were examined, and the effect of coding attitudes on CT cognitive performance was analyzed with linear regression. Results showed that ESCAS (Chinese) was a valid and reliable attitudinal scale, and coding interest could predict CT performance. Future directions for the study were discussed.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-8429-9","10.1109/ISEC54952.2022.10025227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025227","Attitude scale;Coding education;Computational thinking;Elementary school","Bridges;Atmospheric measurements;Affordances;Linear regression;Education;Particle measurements;Encoding","","3","","11","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
