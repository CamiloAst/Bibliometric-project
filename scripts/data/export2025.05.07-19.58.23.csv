"A MOOC on Computational Thinking for All: Pedagogical Principles, Challenges, and Their Application","N. Ragonis; O.

Responding to the common perception to develop those thinking skills in all learners, and indeed in the entire population, we developed a MOOC on computational thinking. The course advocates the development of computational thinking skills in every human being, at any age, and in any subject matter, emphasizing the common, essential computational thinking skills: problem decomposition, abstraction, and generalization. Based on our belief in the importance of the application of computational thinking skills when using computerized environments, and the importance of its significant application in developing an understanding of any discipline, the course is based on the development of simulations of computational processes in any area of knowledge. We widely discuss the pedagogical challenges of developing a MOOC on thinking skills without teacher-learner interaction, and share how we overcame these challenges by implementing the Four Pedagogies for Developing Computational Thinking (4P4CT) framework, which integrates the pedagogies of active learning, project-based learning, product-based learning, and context-based learning. We present preliminary findings from research we conducted during the first two MOOC cycles with about 1,600 learners. Specifically, quantitative and qualitative data analysis of students' learning processes are discussed, reflecting the students' multi-faceted and deep engagement in the MOOC.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-2028-2","10.1109/CSCI58124.2022.00350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216563","computational thinking;teacher education;4P4CT;active learning;project-based learning;product-based learning;context-based learning;MOOC","Computer aided instruction;Electronic learning;Data analysis;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Sociology;Education","","","","38","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Once the methodological framework was defined, we proceeded to develop a computer tool that provides global support for the implementation of this methodology. The implemented platform has a simple and intuitive design that allows an easy use of it since it is aimed at pre-university students and teachers who necessarily do not have advanced knowledge of Computer Science. Finally, the platform automatically provides progress reports and course development, including statistical data by age or gender, among others.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363311","computational thinking;problem solving;21st century skills;methodology for development and assessment;pre-university education;web platform;Abstractly","Tools;Problem-solving;Education;Programming profession;Proposals;Computational modeling","","6","","13","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In maker culture, the ability to program along with other technical skills often exceeds this limitation and also includes fun activities through personally fabricated projects. In this paper, we examine computational design projects that are intended to be 3D printed and could potentially introduce coding learning actions. To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-9506-7","10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725202","3D printing;personal fabrication;computational design;computational thinking;online makerspace","Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays;Fabrication;Solid modeling;Encoding;Computational modeling","","3","","27","IEEE","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249761","Ministry of Higher Education via a Research Grant Award(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/UKM/02/9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054368","Robotics;computational thinking;adversarial thinking;experiential learning model","Robots;Computational modeling;Systematics;Education;Mathematical models;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","8","","131","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs.

Based on this, this study used a large-scale questionnaire to construct a model with problem-solving ability and learning anxiety as mediators with 8,134 Chinese elementary school students. The results showed that CT was a significant direct predictor of academic achievement; problem-solving ability and learning anxiety played significant mediator roles between CT and students’ academic achievement.

It gives a logical idea to the students to solve a problem systematically using algorithm development, flowchart design and programming and problem-solving skills. CT increases the confidence among students in dealing with complexity of difficult problems, the capacity to handle complex issues and collaborate with others to find a shared purpose or solution.
