This vision of computational materials is similarly motivated. Indeed, inspiration is critical at this time, because there are so many challenges to overcome and it will take a community to address them. Significant technical challenges and a desire to deliver meaningful value while guarding against violations of greater societal values can only happen if we are fueled by the passion of this vision.","1558-2590","","10.1109/MPRV.2020.2982475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9094291","","Sensors;Manufacturing;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Substrates;Industries","","10","","15","IEEE","15 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Performance of distributed apriori algorithms on a computational grid","S. S. Rawat; L. Rajamani","Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India; College of Engineering, Osmania University, India",2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC),"22 Jan 2010","2009","","","163","167","When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.","","978-1-4244-5338-2","10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394128","Association rules;Data mining;Grid computing;High performance","Distributed computing;Grid computing;Biology computing;Chemical technology;Marine technology;Space technology;Application software;Astronomy;Astrochemistry;Data engineering","","1","","10","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A TDRL Model for the Emotion of Regret","J. Broekens; L. Dai","Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands; Human Media Interaction, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands",2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII),"9 Dec 2019","2019","","","150","156","To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.","2156-8111","978-1-7281-3888-6","10.1109/ACII.2019.8925441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925441","Emotion;TDRL Emotion Theory;Computational Modelling;Regret","Computational modeling;Learning (artificial intelligence);Appraisal;Task analysis;Affective computing;Psychology;Robots","","7","","41","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene, given a reasonably large database of known objects. The system uses massively parallel hypotheses generation and parameter space clustering in place of serial constraint propagation. Local boundary features that constrain an object's position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This greatly reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested. Experiments show that the time required by this approach scales at a much slower range than either the number of objects in the database or objects in the scene.<>","1063-6919","0-8186-0862-5","10.1109/CVPR.1988.196335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=196335","","Object recognition;Layout;Testing;Spatial databases;Machine vision;Concurrent computing;Image databases;Object oriented databases;Parallel architectures;Image processing","","21","","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics.

These problems are manifested as combinatorial complexity of algorithms, of their computational or training requirements. The paper relates particular types of complexity problems to the roles of a priori knowledge and adaptive learning. Paradigms based on adaptive learning lead to the complexity of training procedures, while nonadaptive rule-based paradigms lead to complexity of rule systems. Model-based approaches to combining adaptivity with a priori knowledge lead to computational complexity. Arguments are presented for the Aristotelian logic being culpable for the difficulty of combining adaptivity and a priority. The potential role of the fuzzy logic in overcoming current difficulties is discussed. Current mathematical difficulties are related to philosophical debates of the past.","1939-3539","","10.1109/34.683784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=683784","","Pattern recognition;Neural networks;Fuzzy logic;Explosions;Neurons;Computational complexity;Adaptive algorithm;Function approximation;Mathematics;History","","95","","49","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
