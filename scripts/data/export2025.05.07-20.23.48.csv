Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.","","978-0-9960-0787-0","10.23919/ROPACES.2018.8364197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8364197","Numerical Linear Algebra;Sparse Matrix Direct Methods;Finite Element Methods","Sparse matrices;Finite element analysis;Matrix decomposition;Iterative methods;Symmetric matrices;Electromagnetics;Computational modeling","","","","3","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The report recognizes the need for a centralized forum to address these limits by allowing innovators to propose their ideas to domain experts and peers. An online platform where students may submit projects, have them reviewed by mentors, and examine other students’ projects. An assessment of existing systems identified a variety of restrictions for students. Such a platform aims to inspire creative thinking and the execution of unique ideas, hence helping students by boosting cooperation, networking, and project-based learning. This platform serves as a dynamic social hub, allowing students to communicate, present work, and exchange ideas in a lively digital setting. The major project is at the center of a student’s academic journey, a necessary component of their graduation process that challenges them to apply their gathered knowledge to create something unique. Students are currently unaware of their peers accomplishment due to a lack of engagement. This website seeks to address this issue by allowing students to discover their skills and find inspiration for their projects. The platform is intended to streamline the tasks of project mentors and teams. Furthermore, developing a dedicated web portal for our college community enhances access to completed projects, making it a great resource for students of all levels. Centralizing project information aims to encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration, ultimately improving the learning experience and developing a culture of student-driven innovation.","","979-8-3315-1679-6","10.1109/CINE63708.2024.10881714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10881714","Project repository;Database;Innovative Projects;Collaboration;PHP","Technological innovation;Linux;Collaboration;Project management;Aerodynamics;Boosting;Appraisal;Portals;Computational intelligence;Testing","","","","11","IEEE","18 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The initial process where the learners have to parse information into symbols using adequate representations, has hardly been considered systematically so far. However, encoding development is essential for the understanding of sign processes and for general education. This paper therefore presents the development and evaluation of a teaching unit called “Cup Song Encoding” designed to model information encoding using a percussion song as an example. It simultaneously imparts coding theory concepts and fosters Computational Thinking of students. The material of the teaching unit is available online. The teaching unit was successfully tested with over 200 students in different age groups in K-12 during which the students' solutions were recorded and examined. The outcomes of the unit demonstrate the potential for encoding modeling to be a valuable addition to K-12 computer science education. The results also show how Computational Thinking methods can be integrated in computer science classes.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578599","K-12 Computer Science Education;Encoding;Computational Modeling;Semiotics;Computational Thinking","Computer science;Computational modeling;Symbols;Encoding;Computer science education;Problem-solving","","","","29","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10650943","computational creativity;LeakGAN;trigonometric identities;CNN","Geometry;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Generative adversarial networks;Mathematical models;Generators;Data models","","","","41","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.","","979-8-3503-4023-5","10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10404103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10404103","Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Model of mind;Human way of thought","Philosophical considerations;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Robot sensing systems;Iterative methods;Artificial intelligence","","","","14","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is also equally important to obtain the accurate result in time to avoid the serious consequences. In order to address this problem in this paper the author presents some evaluation structure reduction techniques which reduce the computational need of the risk assessment.
