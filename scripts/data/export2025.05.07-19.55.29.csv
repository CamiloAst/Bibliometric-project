There are various ways to develop students’ computational thinking, and at the primary and secondary school levels, graphical programming classes are an important way to do so. This study establishes a framework for an instructional program aimed at developing students’ computational thinking skills based on elementary school graphic programming classes. Combining curriculum standards, graphic programming standards for youth programming skills, and International Computational Thinking Challenge standards, relevant teaching cases are designed to foster students’ computational thinking and promote the development of computational concepts, computational practices, and computational concepts.","2766-2144","979-8-3503-6141-4","10.1109/ISET61814.2024.00081","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10685695","Computational Thinking;Graphical Programming;Teaching","Graphics;Educational technology;Artificial intelligence;Programming profession;Standards","","","","11","IEEE","26 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to keep up with trends in the growing technology-driven world, students should have the ability to analyze and consider the consequences of computing problems critically. However, introducing CS and computational thinking skills to the first year students in college is a difficult task because the nature of the subject tends to be dry and conceptual. Thus, we introduce a computer science course that helps all undergraduate students to prepare for digital life as well as enhance their critical thinking skills through hands-on learning experiences. The course contents introduce the general concept of computer science such as computing system, basic networking, algorithms and programming with Scratch and mBot robot exercises. Our student feedback shows a high level of enthusiasm and engagement among the students. The strong hands-on learning nature of the course helped our students to have more engaging and interactive classroom experiences.","","978-1-5386-2652-8","10.1109/CSCI.2017.187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560947","Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking;Hands-on;Robot programming","","","","","16","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results show that: (a) the achievement levels of computational thinking competences differ significantly between the Lima group and the Amazonas group, (b) the highest levels of competence achievement are associated with students who had some level of previous instruction in secondary education, and (c) the differences in the achievement of computational thinking skills according to student gender are not significant.","","978-1-7281-9365-6","10.1109/ANDESCON50619.2020.9272097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272097","computational thinking;education in engineering;Peru;Latin America;vulnerable environments","Education;Analysis of variance;Programming profession;Conferences;Training;Standards;Engineering students","","2","","23","IEEE","1 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe the early stages of a project aiming to reform the CFP curriculum, such that CT skills becomes an integral part. As a first step, we carried-out four introductory workshops with 64 first-and third-semester CFP students and then surveyed them to gather their perceptions on CT. The results show that the students have a limited understanding of CT and its associated skills, but they recognize their importance. Moreover, they agree that primary school should be the starting point to develop them. The project will continue gathering information from current CFP teachers, current primary school teachers, and university professors who are experts in curriculum development, to develop the curricular proposal.","","978-1-7281-4286-9","10.1109/LACLO49268.2019.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8995162","Computational Thinking;Curriculum design;Teacher training","","","2","","27","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
