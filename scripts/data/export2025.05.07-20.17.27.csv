We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.","2476-2172","979-8-3503-7661-6","10.1109/SIIE63180.2024.10604485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10604485","Computational Thinking;Ontology;OntoCnE;Learning Resources;Neuroeducation","Systematics;Education;Ontologies;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Guidelines","","","","16","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Parra","Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; International Institute of Social Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Hague, The",2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"26 Feb 2025","2024","","","1","5","This work-in-progress research paper reflects on findings from a program evaluation of a nationwide professional development (PD) initiative designed to enhance computational thinking (CT) skills among teachers in Colombia's public schools. Evaluating CT education programs presents challenges due to the limited research on the validity and reliability of data collection tools. In addition, evaluation of PD programs in CT often overlooks affective factors and fails to align with program outcomes beyond the training context, leading to insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. This study seeks to identify the factors that influence the effective implementation of CT teaching practices and contribute to the body of knowledge of professional development programs. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted pre-post surveys to assess changes in teachers' knowledge, followed by realist-based focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into participants' experiences and the factors influencing classroom implementation. The primary contribution of this paper is providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving changes in teachers' practices after participating in a CT-focused PD program in a middle-income country. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in teachers' CT knowledge post-intervention. Qualitative findings highlight the importance of teachers' confidence in their CT knowledge and the need for comprehensive school support for effective CT integration.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893070","Ministry of Education; British Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893070","Computational thinking;Professional development;Content knowledge;Mixed-Methods;Program evaluation","Training;Surveys;Data collection;Reliability","","","","24","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pictograms are constructed objects at a high level of abstraction. Abstraction, decomposition, and pattern recognition, which are all core concepts of computational thinking, are also essential ability for pictogram content creation. And if the structure of pictograms can be described as a procedural program, then it is based on algorithmic thinking. Pictoch especially focuses on human pictogram. This effect of the human pictogram can be familiar with “syntonic learning.” advocated by Papert. Pictoch has the instructions for posing and motion of human pictogram, and some more essential functions for making pictograms that drawing various objects and attaching safety signs.

It is important to educate a modern student how to benefit from the up-to-date scientific data and software. It is known that the primary structure of protein is of primary information content; however, the tertiary structure is more conserved. Biochemistry students are educated in a traditional way giving an importance to developing fundamental skills as well as critical thinking. In this article, we demonstrate educational approaches that incorporate computational methods in the course Biochemistry A–CHEM 370.

"My Robot can tell stories: Introducing robotics and physical computing to children using dynamic dioaramas","G. Manikutty","Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, AMMACHI Labs, Amritapuri, India",2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"20 Dec 2021","2021","","","1","9","From time immemorial, stories have caught the fascination of young and old. Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637460","STEM;Physical Computing;Robotics Education;21st Century Skills;Middle School Education;K-12 education","Conferences;Collaboration;Writing;Robot sensing systems;Cultural differences;Global communication;Task analysis","","7","","37","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many researchers and artists are now further attempting to engage the computer actively throughout the development of the narrative itself. Any form of computational narrative authoring is at some level always mixed-initiative , meaning that the processing capabilities of the computer are utilized with a varying degree to automate certain features of the authoring process. We structure this survey by focusing on two key components of stories, plot and space, and more specifically the degree to which these are either automated by the computer or authored manually. By examining the successes of existing research, we identify potential new research directions in the field of computational narrative. We also identify the advantages of developing a standard model of narrative to allow for collaboration between plot and space automation techniques. This would likely benefit the field of automated space generation with the strengths in the field of automated plot generation.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2546063","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(grant numbers:314-99-104); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439785","Automated storytelling;computational narrative authoring;procedural content generation;story generation","Computers;Automation;Manuals;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Aerospace electronics;Visualization","","70","","104","IEEE","23 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
