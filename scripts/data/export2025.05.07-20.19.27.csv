This lightning talk delves into a virtual reality education and entertainment application named Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836179","","Programming profession;Virtual reality;Education;Computers;Three-dimensional displays;Programming environments","","5","","10","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the elementary level, computational thinking (CT) has been used as a framework for bringing CS ideas into the classroom and educating teachers about how they can integrate CT into their daily instruction. A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers. We highlight this approach using classroom video observation from four teachers and discuss future work in this area.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620608","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1738677); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620608","","Economics;Computer science;Atmospheric measurements;Tools;Linguistics;Particle measurements;Videos","","","","6","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such proposals for the automatic processing of metaphors range from a hand-coded rule system to deep learning techniques. The initial stage in the process of metaphor comprehension, often regarded as the most challenging, involves Pre-processing stage for metaphor identification then Feature extraction, Metaphor Identification, Classification, Interpretation and Evaluation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the theoretical foundations of metaphors, as well as the various models and practical applications that have been suggested for computational metaphor processing, including the tasks of metaphor detection and comprehension. We suggested an approach for computational metaphor processing using large language models.","","979-8-3503-7971-6","10.1109/GlobalAISummit62156.2024.10947867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10947867","Metaphor;conceptual metaphor;linguistic metaphor;metaphor processing;metaphor detection;metaphor interpretation;figurative language;Large language models;Natural language processing","Deep learning;Reviews;Large language models;Computational modeling;Linguistics;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Proposals","","","","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We report on two senior-level software engineering courses, taught a total of six times across three semesters. The paper gives enough information for readers to adapt this method in their own courses. Our exams include built-in divergence properties, which are elements or decisions that lead students to more than one good answer. Based on our experience, divergent thinking, creative problem solving exams not only provide excellent assessments of student knowledge, but ensure the integrity of the exam process, even when students work without supervision. We developed this strategy during the pandemic when all courses were online, but find them to be better than our traditional exams and are now using this strategy for in-person courses.","","978-1-6654-9592-9","10.1145/3510456.3514162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794155","final exam;e-learning","Training;Pandemics;Distance learning;Computational modeling;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Software engineering","","","","19","CCBY","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The Unfitness of Traditional Military Thinking in Cyber","J. Kallberg; T. S.

Four tenets of the cyber world present profound challenges for the application of traditional military strategies in cyber conflicts. The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown. As a result, the use of traditional military thinking and path-dependent behavior in cyber is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions regarding strategic achievements and abilities in the pre-conflict stage, and increase the risk of strategic failure during conflict and provide an opportunity for an adversary's strategic surprise.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7896576","Cyber operations;cyber defense;offensive cyber operations;information operations","Military computing;Command and control systems;Time measurement;Context;Decision making;Cyberspace;Firing","","5","","19","USGov","12 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this, it is advisable to apply the architecture approach, developing an initial complex of the essential views of the corresponding architectural description. The complex must not only provide an initial understanding of the future system but also demonstrates the conditions under which the intended goals will be attained. We propose a version of creating the complex by solving the systems of conceptual equations, any of which corresponds to the cause-and-effect discourse of an abductive kind. The version is realized in the instrumental environment that supports automated design thinking.","","978-1-7281-2847-4","10.1109/ICCSA.2019.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8853639","architectural modeling;design thinking;goal;motivational design;software intensive system;viewpoint","Mathematical model;Task analysis;Cognition;Software;Instruments;Stakeholders;Semantics","","","","16","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
