Blocks-based programming is useful in scaffolding learners in the early stage of programming tasks. We posit that students can authentically interact with agent-based modeling via a blocks-based dialect of the popular ABM language NetLogo, dubbed NetTango, across many difficulty levels. Specifically, we discuss three different activities in which we have integrated blocks-based programming into STEM classrooms that show blocks can be used for activities of increasing computational engagement and difficulty.","","978-1-7281-4849-6","10.1109/BB48857.2019.8941204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8941204","agent-based modeling;NetLogo;STEM education;blocks-based programming","Programming;Biological system modeling;Tools;Ecosystems;Agent-based modeling","","1","","29","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Computational thinking (CT) is a term invented by “J.M. Wing, 2006” to describe a set of thinking skills, behaviors, and approaches that are integral to solving complex challenges using a computer and widely applicable in the information society. CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497195","","Programming profession;Buildings;Information and communication technology;Shape;Qualifications;Problem-solving;Government","","","","","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tests for evaluating cognitive components are based on submitting the subject to a given task and then assessing performance according to an established set of reference parameters. In order to analyze subject's behavior and test results, a software tool was developed based upon digital ink technology, which permits the digitalization of the assessment procedure, from the undertaking of the test to the production of the assessment results. By doing so, the test procedure is computerized and its data is saved in InkML format and processed to analyze tasks previously defined by the evaluator. We have used this tool to develop a Computational Thinking test defined within the Cattell-Horn-Carroll CHC framework of intelligence. Further investigating the relationship between fluid intelligence and computational thinking allows a better understanding of the main set of cognitive skills which need to be developed by students and professionals that aim to work in this domain. Moreover, it is suggested that assessments, independent of their context, may benefit from using the InkML tool, mainly due to the richer set of information that can be collected.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044237","computational thinking;digital ink;task analysis;tools;cognitive assessment","Ink;Programming profession;Cognition;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Computers","","21","","29","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637467","computational thinking;gamification;adaptive learning;independent learning;online education platform","Computer languages;Visualization;Electronic learning;Conferences;Education;Games;Problem-solving","","7","","34","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the growing momentum in integrating CT into K-12 education, a higher need can be seen in developing proper assessment tools to measure what students have learned about CT. Although numerous attempts have been made to design CT assessment tools, there is a scarcity of well-validated tests for summative assessment aimed at lower primary students. To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2. Results indicate that the test is balanced regarding the difficulty level for the target group. Item analysis was conducted for each item, based on which decisions about the refinement of the test were made. Directions for future research are discussed.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-3687-8","10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678852","computational thinking;assessment;diagnostic test;K-12 education;lower primary students","Bridges;Education;Aging;Interviews;Testing","","5","","28","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing research has attempted to increase interaction and enhance the learning interest of elementary school students through block-based programming environments represented by Scratch. However, criticism suggests that this approach has potential long-term constraints on CT education. Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.","2475-1510","","10.1109/TG.2022.3143701","Computer Center of the Children's Palace, China Welfare Institute; Osaka University Foundation for Future; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684681","Computational thinking (CT);elementary education;game-based learning;learning motivation;programming","Programming profession;Education;Programming environments;Games;Computer languages;C++ languages;Problem-solving","","7","","46","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
