In view of the existing problems of traditional teaching methods in high vocational colleges, we propose a teaching method aimed at developing the computational thinking of students. This article analyses the courses of high vocational colleges and the characteristics of students firstly. Then we design the teaching activities based upon the principles and strategies of computational thinking. Finally we offer a real teaching case. The teaching evaluations from students indicate that the teaching method based on computational thinking is very effective.","","978-1-4799-2951-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2014.6926576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926576","High vocational colleges;computational thinking;active directory","Computers;Educational institutions;Laboratories","","","","10","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In consequence, educators and students are facing this discipline for the first time. Although there are many technologies that assist teachers and learners in the learning of this competence, there is a lack of tools that support them in the assessment tasks. This paper compares the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch, a free/libre/open source software assessment tool for Scratch, with McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead's metrics, two classic software engineering metrics that are globally recognized as a valid measurement for the complexity of a software system. The findings, which prove positive, significant, moderate to strong correlations between them, could be therefore considered as a validation of the complexity assessment process of Dr. Scratch.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-8633-3","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474681","computational thinking;Scratch;programming;assessment tools;Dr. Scratch;software metrics;complexity","Measurement;Complexity theory;Correlation;Vocabulary;Programming profession;Fitting","","47","1","25","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.","2623-8764","978-953-233-098-4","10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756712","Computational thinking;Computer science education;CSER;Computational ideas;History of computational thinking;Disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing","","","2","","35","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However., as a cross-domain competency., appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed., the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on using scales or test to measure programming proficiency and neglecting process evaluation in which CT can also be manifested. Game-based learning assessments (GBLA) are able to assess tacit knowledge by avoiding jargon in test items., constructing irrelevant material., and reducing anxiety., avoiding the barriers of traditional assessments in assessing students' abilities. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT., it is necessary to integrate diverse problem-solving contexts using a digital game-based assessment model to measure CT. We invited 13 experts to participate in three rounds of the Delphi method and constructed a CT skills assessment model based on the digital game. The model had good consistency and was divided into four primary indicators., namely “Analysis”., “Design”., “Iteration”., and “Generalization”., which were weighted as 0.26., 0.11., 0.24., and 0.39., respectively and 14 secondary indicators. Taken together., the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating digital games in measuring CT skills in a comprehensive manner.","","978-1-6654-8188-5","10.1109/CSTE55932.2022.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973071","computational thinking skills;digital game;assessment model","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Education;Games;Predictive models;Particle measurements;Indexes","","2","","25","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper described a classical example about problem solving to explain the teaching process of the PBL-VP in detail. The process of problem solving was divided into several operable steps to gradually guide students to analyze problems, provide solutions and establish scientific logic thinking. Blockly was introduced to obscure the grammar of programming language and implement the algorithm visually. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the PBL-VP teaching method on student learning by a contrast test. The empirical results proved that students in the class with PBL-VP earned higher final grades and the teaching method we proposed played a positive role in computer general education.","2473-9464","978-1-7281-1846-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2019.8845503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845503","Problem-Based Learning (PBL);visual programing;computational thinking;problem solving;computer general education","Education;Visualization;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Navigation;Mathematical model","","8","","9","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As for the subsequent intensive statistical analysis, R environment was more suitable. We demonstrate summary results of the statistical analysis of the computer thinking diagnostic test for primary and secondary schools, finally cross-checked in SPSS software.
