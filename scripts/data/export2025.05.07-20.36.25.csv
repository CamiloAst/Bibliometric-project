Artificial intelligence (AI) has investigated the general intelligence capacity of machines within the domain of games more than any other domain given the ideal properties of games for that purpose: controlled yet interesting and computationally hard problems. This line of research, however, has so far focused solely on one specific way of which intelligence can be applied to games: playing them. In this paper, we build on the general game-playing paradigm and expand it to cater for all core AI tasks within a game design process. That includes general player experience and behavior modeling, general non-player character behavior, general AI-assisted tools, general level generation and complete game generation. The new scope for general general game AI beyond game-playing broadens the applicability and capacity of AI algorithms and our understanding of intelligence as tested in a creative domain that interweaves problem solving, art, and engineering.","2325-4289","978-1-5090-1883-3","10.1109/CIG.2016.7860385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860385","","Games;Artificial intelligence;Benchmark testing;Conferences;Software;Computational intelligence","","11","","105","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this model we propose a self-organizing mechanism to build episodic and semantic memories on the cognitive level. Neurons in this approach represent symbolic concepts that are stored and associated with each other based on the observed events in the environment. We demonstrate that the associative neuron and their synaptic connections yield memories that are capable to recognize sequences of events and therefore can be a foundation for episodic memories. We also demonstrate that semantic memories build using these neuron models are capable to store the knowledge and respond in a novel, creative way to input stimuli. The paper presents the developed associative neuron model, neural network organization that results from input sequences, and simulation results.","","978-1-5090-4240-1","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850029","associative neurons;declarative memory;episodic memory;semantic memory;emergent creativity","Neurons;Biological system modeling;Semantics;Training;Computational modeling;Permeability","","8","","21","IEEE","13 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems","T. Hirashima","Dept. Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan",2017 3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech),"15 Jan 2018","2017","","","1","6","Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.","","978-1-5090-5866-2","10.1109/ICSITech.2017.8257076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257076","Computer-based Intelligence Support;Ill-Structured Problem;Moderately Ill-Structured Problem;Domain Model;Problem Setting;Arithmetic Word Problems","Computational modeling;Information technology;Problem-solving;Monitoring;Numerical models;Artificial intelligence","","2","","24","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program. This paper discusses the methods of assessment used and the results.","0190-5848","0-7803-3348-9","10.1109/FIE.1996.569967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569967","","Educational institutions;US Department of Energy;Laboratories;Energy management;Contracts;Computational modeling;Mathematics;Problem-solving;Software testing;Data visualization","","1","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, von Neumann in his classic ""First Draft"" warned that it would be unsound to use his suggested paradigm to model neural operation, furthermore that using ""too fast"" processors vitiates his paradigm, which was intended only to describe (the timing relations of) vacuum tubes. Thus, it is worth scrutinizing how the present technology solutions can be used to mimic biology. Some electronic components bear a surprising resemblance to some biological structures. However, combining them using different principles can result in systems with inferior efficacy. The paper discusses how the conventional computing principles, components, and thinking about computing limit mimicking biological systems.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457997","","Computers;Program processors;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Electronic components;Biological systems","","1","","41","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"A New Computational Method for Quantification and Analysis of Media Bias in Cybersecurity Reporting","F. K. Sufi","COEUS Institute, New Market, VA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"","2025","PP","99","1","10","The proliferation of cyber threats and their representation in news media significantly influence public awareness and policy-making. However, biases in cybersecurity news reporting—manifested as location focus, event significance prioritization, and coverage of specific attack types or industries—distort perceptions and resource allocations. This study addresses these challenges by developing an artificial intelligence-driven computational framework that analyzes and quantifies biases in cybersecurity news. Leveraging a dataset of 1.23 million news articles, which was filtered down to 9314 cybersecurity-related events spanning 144 sources over five quarters, the methodology employs GPT-based classification, Shannon entropy, chi-square tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Bayesian inference to identify patterns and dependencies in reporting. Results reveal that generalized sources such as BBC exhibit high reporting diversity (H = 2.87), while specialized outlets such as Cybersecurity Insider display niche focus (H = 0.45). Multinomial logistic regression achieved 81.2% accuracy in predicting reporting tendencies based on event significance and source characteristics. Bayesian inference highlighted significant tendencies, such as Dark Reading’s preference for advanced persistent threats (posterior probability = 0.62) and CNBC’s emphasis on phishing events (posterior probability = 0.48). Furthermore, this framework can be extended to other open-source media, such as social media platforms, to pinpoint and measure the level of bias exhibited by individual users, marking a significant step toward identifying misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The proposed framework not only provides actionable insights for stakeholders but also establishes a scalable model for analyzing biases in other domains, fostering informed decision-making and balanced reporting practices.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2025.3560199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10988747","Bias detection;bias measurement;media bias analysis;open-source news bias;social perception monitoring","Media;Computer security;Industries;Entropy;Decision making;Analytical models;Posterior probability;Bayes methods;Vectors;Uniform resource locators","","","","","IEEE","5 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Clark described his machine as an illustration of a theory of “kaleidoscopic evolution” whereby the Latin verse is “conceived in the mind of the machine” then mechanically produced and displayed. We describe the background to automated generation of verse, the design and mechanics of Eureka, its reception in London in 1845 and its place in the history of language generation by machine. The article interprets Clark's theory of kaleidoscopic evolution in terms of modern cognitive science. It suggests that Clark has not been given the recognition he deserves as a pioneer of computational creativity.","1934-1547","","10.1109/MAHC.2023.3241258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10038656","History of computing;cognitive simulation;natural language;language generation;computational creativity;clockwork;hexameter Latin verse;19th century cognitive science;kaleidoscopic evolution;Babbage;thinking machine","Wires;Creativity;Wheels;Flywheels;Windows;Rhythm;Meters","","1","","34","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
