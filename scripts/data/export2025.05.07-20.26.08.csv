The models were fine-tuned using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and a custom essay scoring dataset, with performance assessed based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), and the R2 Score. Among these, ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated superior performance, achieving an MSE of 4.59, an NMSE of 0.50, and an R2 Score of 0.72. The findings confirm the model's strong alignment with human scoring standards, providing both accuracy and consistency. This study offers a robust framework to enhance automated essay evaluation, reducing reliance on manual grading and promoting fairness. Future studies should focus on addressing limitations such as dataset diversity and computational efficiency to further improve model generalization and scalability. Overall, this research highlights the transformative potential of advanced LLMs in establishing scalable, accurate, and equitable educational assessment systems.","","979-8-3315-1332-0","10.1109/ICADEIS65852.2025.10933114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10933114","Automated Essay Scoring;Large Language Models;API ChatGPT","Accuracy;Large language models;Computational modeling;Scalability;Writing;Chatbots;Data models;Question answering (information retrieval);Reliability;Standards","","","","15","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>","","0-8186-2775-1","10.1109/SHPCC.1992.232636","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=232636","","Computational modeling;Concurrent computing;Supercomputers;Biology computing;Systems engineering and theory;Data structures;Liquids;Solids;Polymers;Chemistry","","4","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.","","0-7803-8352-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323421","","Timing;Resource management;Automatic control;Feeds;Buffer storage;Computational intelligence;Psychology;Control systems;Humans;Intersymbol interference","","","","24","","4 Oct 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems. Prospective applications of holonic granule-based software models are then commented with particular emphasis to industrial automation and environmental monitoring settings.","","978-1-61284-060-4","10.1109/IA.2011.5953620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953620","holon;granular computing;holonic granule;knowledge representation","Mercury (metals);Computational modeling;Software;Organizations;Face;Humans;Communities","","7","","28","IEEE","14 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost. The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to disruptions and strong generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from medium-sized problems to larger, unseen instances.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3521439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812729","Supply chain network design;inventory management;reinforcement learning;thinking model;transformer network","Supply chains;Adaptation models;Optimization;Inventory management;Training;Deep reinforcement learning;Costs;Games;Decision making;Computational modeling","","","","35","CCBY","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.","","979-8-3503-4872-9","10.1109/EDUNINE60625.2024.10500458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10500458","CodeCombat;K-12 programming education;Programming talent search;Learning motivation","Correlation;Search problems;Boosting;Engineering education;Programming profession;Python","","","","22","IEEE","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency.
