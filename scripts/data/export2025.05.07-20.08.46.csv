The term summarizes a set of skills needed to transform real-life challenges into problems that can be solved with the help of a computer and to apply computer-based solutions to questions at hand. This mindset is fundamental to almost every engineering task. However, teaching Computational Thinking is a great challenge for educators worldwide. In designing and implementing university curricula, one has to take an increasing number of arguments into consideration. Technological progress requires the design, creation, and analysis of increasingly large and complex systems. Engineering working environments and tasks demand interdisciplinary teams and close communication between involved groups. In designing engineering curricula, these factors need to be considered and the necessary skills must be implicitly or explicitly developed. This paper highlights three examples of classes and projects aimed at enabling students to develop and increase Computational Thinking through systematic introduction of computational tools. From these successful case studies, the paper derives six best practices for fostering Computational Thinking in engineering education. A review of several examples is given, that are used to highlight and extract best practices. This provides a comprehensive overview of the relationships and simplifies the application of the aforementioned principles to course and curriculum designs.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826132","curriculum development;computational thinking;engineering skill set;education concepts specific for engineering education;industry and engineering education;integrated curriculum;education tools;project based learning","Engineering education;Computers;Educational institutions;MATLAB;Robot sensing systems;Hardware","","17","","33","IEEE","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has transformed scientific research, prompting the need for theories on human-AI collaboration. This book introduces the 3C Theory, which integrates AI with human cognition, emotion, and research thinking (critical thinking, creative thinking, and computational thinking). Within the 3C theoretical model, AI not only as a research tool but as an enhancer of human cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and research thinking. By comparing 3C Theory with existing models, the book highlights its potential to transform research processes and support the design of intelligent Human-AI research systems. Additionally, this paper explores the prospects of intelligent research system design, proposing new avenues for research innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and Human-AI interaction.","","979-8-3315-1982-7","10.1109/IEIR62538.2024.10959988","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10959988","AI-Driven research;research thinking;3C Theory;human-AI interaction;intelligent research system","Technological innovation;Reviews;Computational modeling;Education;Collaboration;Transforms;Solids;Cognition;Artificial intelligence;System analysis and design","","","","40","IEEE","14 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve reliable system intelligence outstanding results, current computational system modeling and simulation community has to face and to solve two orders of modeling limitations at least. As a solution, we propose an exponential, prespatial arithmetic scheme (“all-powerful scheme”) by CICT to overcome the Information Double-Bind (IDB) problem and to thrive on both deterministic noise (DN) and random noise (RN) to develop powerful cognitive computational frameworks for deep learning, towards deep thinking applications. An operative example is presented.

Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.","","978-1-6654-1020-5","10.1109/SMC54092.2024.10831471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10831471","computational logistics;computational thinking;logistics operation;container terminals;machine learning","Automation;Philosophical considerations;Systematics;Processor scheduling;Computational modeling;Supply chains;Computer architecture;Switches;Containers;Logistics","","","","12","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.","","978-1-6654-5331-8","10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398358","Large Language Models;Interactive Learning Environments;Collaborative Learning;Human-Computer Interaction","Computational modeling;Education;Chatbots;User experience;Software;Task analysis;Springs","","","","31","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2332494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871367","Metathinking;systems analysis;systems approach;systems engineering;systems science;systems thinking;Metathinking;systems analysis;systems approach;systems engineering;systems science;systems thinking","Biological system modeling;Cognitive science;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Mathematical model","","31","","52","IEEE","5 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
