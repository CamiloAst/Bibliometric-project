Given the well-known skills demanded for the 21st century, CT needs to be known in the teacher community. One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453940","","Instruments;Current measurement;Conferences;Reliability;Engineering education","","2","","18","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For novice programming, CT activities may help students to learn and appreciate problem-solving and programming capabilities. In this paper, an investigation to study the effectiveness and suitability of an unplugged CT activities has been carried out. This is part of the unplugged CT framework development process, where the first element investigated is the type of suitable activities. Two iterations were conducted to confirm the suitability of the activities. The activities were also verified with a selected group of secondary school teachers. The results have shown that unplugged activities can be effective in helping students to learn programming capability. The next step of the research is to identify other relevant components relevant to the framework for an unplugged CT activities for novice programmer.","","978-1-6654-3689-2","10.1109/ICOCO53166.2021.9673537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9673537","","Computers;Computer languages;Conferences;Education;Problem-solving;IEEE activities;Programming profession","","2","","31","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The chaotic approach is a critical component of the theoretical framework and can be used in analyzing complex biological structures such as chromatin structures. Fractality is a metric of complexity in biological functions; it is an indicator of the complication level of the self-similar structure, while chaos is a sort of dynamic behavior that usually produces totally arbitrary patterns. Fractal measurements in vivo could be used to predict the efficiency of painful therapy. The fractal technique can be used to assess carcinogenesis, tumor progression, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment with the convergence of modern sensing techniques in nano-scale spectroscopic techniques, which is a prospective biomarker. The mathematical principles of fractals and chaos in biological systems are presented in the context of the condition of health treatment and their significance. Fractality in different biological functions including the heart has now been investigated and measured the dosing quantity with chaos and fractal level. As excessive amounts of chaos and fractal complexity are harmful to biological predictions. For biological applications, chaos analysis may be advantageous. This paper is a review which highlights the fractal and chaos theories for biological functions and biomedical systems. The focus will be to explore biological functions, due to its computational machine learning-based demands and capability in mathematical complexity.","","979-8-3503-9648-5","10.1109/InCACCT57535.2023.10141836","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10141836","Fractal and chaos;biological function;health;carcinogenesis;Machine Learning","Technological innovation;Medical treatment;Biomedical measurement;Fractals;Biology;Complexity theory;Sensors","","3","","74","IEEE","8 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. The latest discovery in knowledge science by Wang revealed that the basic unit of knowledge is a binary relation (bir) as that of bit for information and data. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from those of deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by cognitive systems. Fundamental theories and novel technologies for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra and inference algebra.","","978-1-5386-0771-8","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2017.8109802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109802","Cognitive informatics;cognitive computers;cognitive robotics;brain-inspired systems;deep learning;deep reasoning;deep thinking;knowledge learning;denotational mathematics;mathematical engineering;semantic computing;cognitive linguistics;applications","Handheld computers;Cognitive informatics;Software;Mathematics","","11","","","IEEE","16 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Equations in math make everything more balanced. When putting together and organizing AI project data, it's important to think about ethics, the environment, and the best ways to make things. Any AI project can get a score from SustainAlign for how sustainable it is. This number shows how long the project will last by looking at how it will affect the world and how many resources it will use. EthixScan computes the ethical commitment score to assess the ethical nature of AI solutions, taking into account their openness and bias levels. InnoMerge assigns an Innovation Catalyst Score to AI projects that integrate important goals to generate new ones. The final Cross-Synergy score is determined by adding the marks for innovation, ethics, and the environment.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","","9","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant.","","978-1-5386-7266-2","10.1109/IEMCON.2018.8614898","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614898","ANFIS;Input space partitioning method;Prediction","Adaptation models;Clustering methods;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Fuzzy sets","","3","","15","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
