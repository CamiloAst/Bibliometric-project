Current researches in the study of using VPLs for educational purposes primarily focus on understanding motivational benefits and computational thinking gains. All these educational VPLs claim to scaffold students learning computational thinking concepts. Although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not clear what computational thinking concepts are actually learned by students. In this paper, we attempt to develop a visual programs recognition tool for student-created StarLogo TNG simulations which representing the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through collecting student's created projects over time, this visual programs recognition tool can possibly indicate the patterns of computational thinking in science simulations created by StarLogo TNG.","","978-1-4673-8985-3","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2016.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7557641","Visual programming languages;computer science education;computational thinking;StarLogo TNG","Computational modeling;Programming profession;Visualization;Ice;Computers;Syntactics","","4","","15","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The findings of those studies are quite positive, especially concerning the promotion of computational thinking skills. However, many students seem to face difficulties in the processes of the game development, such as debugging, applying mathematics, or physics subjects. Additionally, students often have solved the problems and understood concepts, mainly math formulas and physics concepts, alone while creating their games. This study presents an innovative curriculum design that suggests two students playing different role to make motion-based touchless games (i.e., games that are based on natural user interaction technologies, like the Microsoft Kinect camera or Leap Motion). Based on the requirements of the innovative curriculum and interaction technologies, students can naturally fulfill the ideal of pair programming and get various benefits from each other.","","978-1-5386-7447-5","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2018.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693273","computational thinking;learning by making games;natural user interaction;Kinect;pair programming","Games;Programming;Tools;Face;Cameras;Collaboration;Task analysis","","5","","16","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model blends six critical types of thinking, i.e., logical thinking, systems thinking, sustainable thinking, strategic thinking, creative thinking, and responsible thinking into the design of a first-year undergraduate programming course. The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan.Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course.Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens.Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course. The underlying theoretical basis of these activities revolve around three key principles: 1) experiential learning; 2) self-reflection; and 3) peer learning.Findings: This case study from a liberal educational institution in India qualitatively shows evidence of students developing six critical elements of thinking that shapes their future CT ability.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3394060","seed fund given to Kalluri’s Urban Design and Open-innovation Studio at FLAME University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10530940","21st-century skills;computer science (CS);creative pedagogy;foundational education;future thinking","Education;Sustainable development;Computational modeling;Systems thinking;Programming profession;Software systems;Green products","","","","35","IEEE","15 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, this paper presents the development and evaluation of the EDG “Pensar e Vestir” (PeV). This game addresses a daily life activity, the process of choosing clothes and the act of wearing them, and aims to promote the development of CT in children both neurotypical and with ID. The development process was supported by ID, Education, and Specialized Education Treatment specialists based on accessibility guidelines. In the end, there were two evaluations, firstly with the specialists and then with Computation students, to validate the functional and technical requirements.

It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970131","computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology","","","6","","15","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

STEM incorporates an interdisciplinary approach that includes inquiry, analysis, critical thinking, practical experimentation, and cooperative problem-solving. Technological advancements are offering new ways to integrate new tools such as drones, robotics and gaming in teaching and learning practices and modify the pedagogical approaches that are more appealing and engaging. This paper presents an innovative pedagogical approach and practice that integrate drone technology and block-based programming to foster students' computation thinking in a STEM context. The block-based visual programming languages provide an interactive environment to connect the blocks and write programs. The study was conducted in six Australian schools. Students were assigned projects to automate drones using the DroneBlocks app and make programs to fly the drone in different geometrical patterns; straight line, arch, rectangle, triangles and zig-zag and integrate the various manoeuvres; bounce, 8D flips, and throw & go along flight paths. Students' computational thinking development was examined with an emphasis on their performance in formulating and problem-solving. Results have shown that integrated drone and programming pedagogy contributed significantly to students' learning of developing computational thinking for problem-solving and decomposing a problem into smaller parts in a sequence that includes mathematical algorithms to write programs.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9943-1","10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125117","Charles Darwin University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10125117","Drone Technology;Coding;Computational Thinking;Block-based Programming;Tello Edu Drones","Visualization;Writing;Encoding;Pattern recognition;Problem-solving;Task analysis;Programming profession","","8","","10","Crown","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
