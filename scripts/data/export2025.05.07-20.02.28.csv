However, few empirical studies have investigated the use of ChatGPT to customize a learning system for scaffolding students’ computational thinking. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent programming scaffolding system using ChatGPT following the theoretical framework of computational thinking and scaffolding. A mixed-method study was conducted to investigate the affordance of the scaffolding system using ChatGPT, and the findings show that most students had positive attitudes about the proposed system, and it was effective in improving their computational thinking generally but not their problem-solving skills. Therefore, more scaffolding strategies are discussed with the aim of improving student computational thinking, especially regarding problem-solving skills. The findings of this study are expected to guide future designs of generative artificial intelligence tools embedded in intelligent learning systems to foster students’ computational thinking and programming learning.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3392896","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62177039); Key Projects of Scientific Research in Higher Education in Chongqing(grant numbers:cqgj23005B); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62277043); Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Innovation and Development Joint(grant numbers:CSTB2023NSCQ-LZX0094); Research Funds for the Southwest University(grant numbers:SWU2108023); Innovation Research 2035 Pilot Plan of Southwest University(grant numbers:SWUPilotPlan002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10508087","Artificial-intelligence-generated content (AIGC);ChatGPT;computational thinking (CT);scaffolding","Chatbots;Education;Programming profession;Codes;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Encoding","","3","","64","CCBYNCND","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Developing Computational Thinking Skills With Algorithm-Driven Spreadsheeting","M. Csernoch; P. Biró; J.

The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126757","construction(grant numbers:EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00002); European Union through the European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606871","Algorithm-driven spreadsheeting;long lasting knowledge;schema construction;cognitive load;end-user computing;computational thinking","Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Informatics;Mathematics;Task analysis","","5","","128","CCBY","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fewer projects investigate the development of computational thinking in students in the last years of school, who usually have not had early formal preparation to acquire these skills. This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students. These results indicate that teaching a low-level programming language is useful, but it has high entry-barriers.","1522-4902","978-1-5386-9233-2","10.1109/SCCC.2018.8705239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705239","Computational Thinking Test;C++;Programming in High School","C++ languages;Visualization;Media;Education;Conferences;Silicon compounds","","4","","30","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The evaluative focus of current research in the area of visual languages for educational purposes primarily aims to better understand motivational benefits as compared to traditional programming languages. Often these visual languages claim to teach students computational thinking concepts; however, although the evaluations show that students may exhibit more enthusiasm, it is not always clear what computational thinking concepts students have actually learned. In this paper we attempt to develop a visual semantic evaluation tool for student-created games and simulations that goes towards depicting the computational thinking concepts implemented by the students. Through semantically analyzing a given student's created projects over time, this visual evaluation tool, called the Computational Thinking Pattern (CTP) graph, can possibly indicate the existence of computational thinking transfer from games to science simulations.","1943-6106","978-1-4244-8485-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2010.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635189","Computational Thinking;Visual Language Programming;Knowledge Transfer","Games;Visualization;Semantics;Programming;Syntactics;Computer languages;Computational modeling","","52","","19","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
