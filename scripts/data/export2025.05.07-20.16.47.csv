In an effort to support social creativity in organizations, in this paper we present computational intelligence software tools for that aim and an architecture for creating software mashups based on the concept of affinity space. The affinity space defines a digital setting to facilitate specific scenarios in collaborative business environments. The solution presented includes a set of free and open source software tools ranging from newly developed brainstorming applications to an expertise recommender for enhancing social creativity in the enterprise.

To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage. The Human Face of Big Data project, a digital curation and interface design project for urban renewal data, is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the validity of the suggested heuristics.

First, because modeling has demonstrated its value for relatively simple tasks, practitioners are asking for help with tasks in increasingly complex domains. Second, as international interchanges increase in importance, military, corporate, and humanitarian leaders urgently need to capture and better understand national and regional differences. Computational modeling promises to be a powerful tool for representing complex tasks and testing the validity of these representations. Models might also support decision aids and serve as platforms for training. It's time to extend modeling to better accommodate complexity and to include the variations in behavior, roles, values, and cognition that influence international interchange.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2009.4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4763659","cultural modeling;cross-cultural interaction;dimensions of cultural differences;team functioning","Computational modeling;Cultural differences;Military computing;Decision making;Context modeling;Predictive models;Cognition;Teamwork;Terrorism;Computer networks","","1","","21","IEEE","27 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924343","Pós-Graduação de Instituiçães de Ensino Particulares da Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES-PROSUP), Brazil; Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (CORFO) 14ENI2-26905 “Nueva Ingeniería para el 203”—Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743397","Analytical models;computer science education;data mining;data models;education;games;self-organizing feature maps","Games;Data mining;Education;Self-organizing feature maps;Conferences;Computer science","","20","","47","CCBY","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this sense, we performed a quasi-experiment with students in the Brazilian's Basic Education Regular System (particularly in a group of students around fifteen years old) comparing their performance after being trained with practical activities using exercises in more or less conformity with well known CT concepts and capabilities. Considering the quantitative results obtained, the experimental group outperformed the control group, which worked with exercises in more and less conformity with CT, respectively. The results were statistically significant, suggesting that bringing together CT and mathematics through proper adjustments of classroom practices can have a positive influence on students abilities of solving problems. In order to strengthen this conclusion we also performed a qualitative analysis comprising students and the teacher involved in the quasi-experiment that reinforced our quantitative results.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190655","computational thinking;teaching of mathematics;problem solving ability","Mathematics;Education;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Tools","","11","","20","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, CT is represented through the graphical programming language Scratch according to the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick [1]. This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.","2470-6698","978-1-5386-0900-2","10.1109/TALE.2017.8252356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252356","Computational Thinking;English dialogue learning;Graphical programming language;Classroom effect","Education;Tools;Programming profession;Computer languages;Interviews;Writing","","9","","19","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
