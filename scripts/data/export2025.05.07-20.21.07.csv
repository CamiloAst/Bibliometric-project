"Analyzing Enablers of Big Data Computation of New Business Students: A TISM approach","Y. Qu; X. Wang","School of Economics and Management, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China; School of Economics and Management, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China",2023 IEEE 6th International Conference on Knowledge Innovation and Invention (ICKII),"4 Dec 2023","2023","","","217","220","Cultivating students’ ability to use emerging technologies for innovation is important for the reform of new business education. Technological change needs the thinking revolution essentially so the big data system is of great significance for the construction of talent training programs, implementation of competency requirements, and curriculum teaching design. This study was carried out to identify the main enablers of the big data computation (BTC) in improving the innovation capability of students majoring in business and developing a model based on the contextual relationship among the identified enablers. Initially, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify the enablers of BTC. Then, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) was used to evolve mutual relationships among the identified 17 enablers for developing a hierarchical model. Five key driving enablers, namely data consciousness, system thinking, statistical thinking, model thinking, and analytical thinking were identified as main enablers. Image thinking played an important role in the process of data analysis and application. Suggestions were made to cultivate the student’s BTC from the following three aspects: adding system science courses in the big data specialty, increasing training opportunities for students in using tools and methods of big data management, and improving students' data literacy.","2770-4785","979-8-3503-2353-5","10.1109/ICKII58656.2023.10332733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10332733","big data computation;total interpretive structural modeling;innovation capability","Training;Technological innovation;Analytical models;Systematics;Computational modeling;Big Data;Data models","","","","26","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"VisTA: Integrating Machine Intelligence with Visualization to Support the Investigation of Think-Aloud Sessions","M. Fan; K. Wu; J. Zhao; Y. Li; W. Wei; K. N. Truong",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Waterloo; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"25 Nov 2019","2020","26","1","343","352","Think-aloud protocols are widely used by user experience (UX) practitioners in usability testing to uncover issues in user interface design. It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934797","NSERC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807301","Think-aloud;visual analytics;machine intelligence;user study;usability problems;session review behavior;UX practices","Usability;Visual analytics;Tools;Machine intelligence;Feature extraction;Machine learning","","5","","45","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The flipped classroom model for the course is primarily classified into three stages: pre-class, in-class, and after-class. In the pre-class stage, teachers used online learning platform and MOOC course materials as a tool to help students make due preparation for classroom. In the in-class stage, teachers organized active learning activities featured by experiential learning and collaborative peer work. In the afterclass stage, teachers design practice-oriented and problem-based assignment for students to reflect on the learning content. Meanwhile, it is important for instructors to provide detailed instructions on how to learn with the learning materials prior to class and focus on cultivating students’ higher order thinking skills in the teaching and learning process.","","979-8-3503-0154-0","10.1109/CCAT59108.2023.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10410397","Flipped classroom model;Education research methods course;Effective practices;Blended learning","Surveys;Electronic learning;Computational modeling;Education;Collaboration;Online services;Hybrid learning","","1","","12","IEEE","5 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This reduces software complexity, allowing independent development and verification, but most importantly it clarifies the impact of modeling decisions, assumptions, and approximations. The result is a physically consistent, mathematically rigorous, spatial modeling and simulation framework for cell biology. The Virtual Cell has a rich, interactive user interface which connects to remote services providing scalable access to a modeling database and a large dedicated cluster for shared computation and storage.

Much of the recent research in robotics has focused on improving the speed and control of robots. Today's robots blindly follow orders that have been prepared in advance. In order to make further progress in the acceptance of robots on the factory floor and in new applications such as surgery or service, robots must be able to sense and reason about their environment. We need to devote research to reasoning about geometry and processes. We need better ways of acquiring models than laborious programming in CAD systems. We need methods to represent errors and plan recoveries. These capabilities will be necessary for the autonomous robots of tomorrow.","1050-4729","0-7803-1965-6","10.1109/ROBOT.1995.525254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=525254","","Robot sensing systems;Robot control;Production facilities;Surgery;Computational geometry;Robot programming","","","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A conceptual framework is presented by extracting shared commonalities from many fields. The framework stresses multiple views and multiple levels of understanding in each view. It is argued that granular computing is more about a philosophical way of thinking and a practical methodology of problem solving. By effectively using levels of granularity, granular computing provides a systematic, natural way to analyze, understand, represent, and solve real world problems. With granular computing, one aims at structured thinking at the philosophical level, and structured problem solving at the practical level.","","0-7803-9017-2","10.1109/GRC.2005.1547239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1547239","","Concrete;Problem-solving;Computational modeling;Set theory;Computer science;Uniform resource locators;Stress;Context modeling;Computational intelligence;Fuzzy set theory","","214","","55","IEEE","5 Dec 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Framework to Overcome the Dark Side of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Like ChatGPT in Social Media and Education","P. W. Kim","Department of Korean Language Education, Incheon National University, Incheon, South Korea",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"16 Aug 2024","2024","11","4","5266","5274","As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information. This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process. The zone of proximal development (ZPD) created by educational scaffolding is a quantitative framework that is appropriate for evaluating the effects of GAI. The ZPD generated by GAI that corresponds to scaffolding should be managed so as not to favor or disadvantage specific individuals.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3315237","Incheon National University Research Concentration Professors(grant numbers:2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273208","Algorithm;ChatGPT;data;information;knowledge;and work (DIKW) hierarchy;education;explainable artificial intelligence (XAI);GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL);GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs);generative artificial intelligence (GAI);social media","Chatbots;Artificial intelligence;Taxonomy;Social networking (online);Data models;Knowledge engineering;Generative AI","","3","","20","IEEE","5 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
