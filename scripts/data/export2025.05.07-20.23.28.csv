"Simulating the Cognitive Thought Process with a Modified Genetic Algorithm","P. A. Gadekar; S. V.

It aims to develop computing methodologies and systems inspired by mind’s capabilities. A thought is the most fundamental capability of the mind. Hence it is important in the cognitive computing to understand the Thought Process. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computer model that simulates the Thought Process. The paper proposes that the Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be used for the same. Both cognitive model and computer model of the thought process with the help of GA has been given. In the computer model, a modification of GA has been implemented, which consists of a new crossover operator called Learning Crossover operator. The new crossover operator is not a replacement but is a supplement to the existing crossover operators. The GA is implemented over the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP), which is a classical NP problem and hence the algorithm is possible to be implemented on any other problem. The modification to the GA aims to improve the Thought Process Simulation. But it can also improve the performance of GA, when further explored.","","978-1-6654-4211-4","10.1109/AIMV53313.2021.9670980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670980","Cognitive Computing;Genetic Algorithm;Traveling Salesperson Problem;Thought Process;Natural Selection","Computational modeling;Machine vision;Cognitive systems;Genetic algorithms","","","","10","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2720630","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673309,61203038,61374068); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB160401,JBG160415); Recruitment Program of Global Experts; Science and Technology Development Fund, MSAR(grant numbers:078/2015/A3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959575","Flexible manufacturing system;Petri net;deadlock prevention;think-globally-act-locally approach;maximally permissive supervisor","Petri nets;System recovery;Law;Computational modeling;Niobium;Complexity theory","","5","","56","OAPA","27 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.","","978-1-7281-4640-9","10.1109/ASET48392.2020.9118395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9118395","inter-disciplinary learning;cross-curricular;project-based learning;data analytics;coding;computer programming;global issues;waste management;computational thinking;engineering;digital;Python;academic;curriculum","Waste management;Data analysis;Collaborative work;Encoding;Task analysis;Programming profession;Creativity","","2","","17","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Eukaryotes have been less widely used than prokaryotes in biotechnology, because of the complexity of their genomic structure and biology. The Yeast2.0 project is an international effort to engineer the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to make it easy to manipulate, and to generate random variants using a system called SCRaMbLE. SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published. Our simulator can be applied to the analysis of the fitness landscapes of any organism for which SCRaMbLE has been implemented.","","978-1-6654-0112-8","10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562918","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562918","SCRaMbLE;yeast;simulation;fitness landscape","Microorganisms;Evolution (biology);Conferences;Computational modeling;Genomics;Production;Bioinformatics","","","","37","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
