This study, framed under the double diamond model, utilized the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 to assist in designing a PV cleaning robot. Initially, the study involved in-depth market analysis and field investigations to identify consumer needs and design requirements. Subsequently, the Kano model was applied to effectively categorize and assess consumer needs, successfully pinpointing key design directions. GPT-4 proposed numerous innovative design ideas. We created the selected prototypes to test and chose the most promising one ultimately. The results indicate that the overall performance of the scheme met expectations, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in complex product design.","2473-3547","979-8-3503-1745-9","10.1109/ISCID59865.2023.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494286","large language models;photovoltaic cleaning robot;design innovation;double diamond model","Photovoltaic systems;Industries;Service robots;Computational modeling;Prototypes;Diamonds;Cleaning","","","","10","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper elaborates on the external design cooperation management and divides it into five parts, such as cooperation with the design company, cooperation with the free designers, cooperation with college or research institute, cooperation with rivals and cooperation with the upstream and downstream enterprises. Based on the detailed exposition of various design cooperation forms, it is pointed out that modern enterprise should integrate the external design forces and make a good job of design cooperation management. Only in those ways can good products be designed and the enterprise strategy be carried out.","","978-0-7695-3865-5","10.1109/ISCID.2009.199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5371075","","Companies;Product design;Job design;Art;Computational intelligence;Educational institutions;Outsourcing;Silicon;Collaboration","","","","9","IEEE","31 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe our experiences on design of project GridPSi, a grid-enabled PSE for physical simulation. GridPSi provides a rich suite of functions that facilitate the composition of computational scripts to automate physical simulations by design domain-specific templates for a verity of research fields. The generic functionality provided by it includes problem modeling, mesh file conversion, computational script generation, solution scheme specification and access to grid resources. GridPSi offers a simple interface that is intuitive to users in the human-PSE interactions and ways of thinking. Furthermore, we developed higher-level graphical components named PDE wizards that build upon the core functions to guide users through problem modeling process with minimum effort. By using Unicore as grid middleware, we are lowering the barriers to entry for users wishing to exploit grid technologies","","0-7695-2448-6","10.1109/E-SCIENCE.2005.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1572260","","Grid computing;Computational modeling;Problem-solving;IP networks;Power engineering and energy;Computer science;Power engineering computing;Usability;Physics computing;Mesh generation","","1","","8","IEEE","10 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
