"Systems thinking in fair water resources allocation","K. W. Hipel","Department of Systems Design Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada",2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Computational Cybernetics (ICCC),"3 Oct 2013","2013","","","11","11","Systems thinking approaches are employed to construct a formal decision making methodology for equitably allocating water among competing users in a river basin when taking into account both the societal and physical systems aspects of the allocation problem. In particular, within the societal component of the decision problem, multiple participants, their multiple objectives, equity principles, and economic factors are considered, while the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic and environmental factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide welfare. CWAM is applied to the South Saskatchewan River Basin located in the Canadian province of Alberta to demonstrate how it can be conveniently applied to a water allocation system of systems problem.","","978-1-4799-0063-3","10.1109/ICCCyb.2013.6617570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617570","","Water resources;Resource management;Educational institutions;Rivers;Awards activities;Societies;Cybernetics","","","","","IEEE","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on the idea of outsourcing, a popular trend in business. In a human based genetic algorithm (HBGA), all primary genetic operators are outsourced, i.e. delegated to external human agents. A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.","1062-922X","0-7803-7087-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2001.972056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=972056","","Humans;Genetic algorithms;Electronics packaging;Technological innovation;Multiagent systems;Genetic mutations;Laboratories;Genetic engineering;Evolutionary computation;Natural language processing","","59","12","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the generation which grew up in the e-world, it was natural that their everyday activities were tied to the possibilities offered by the networks. These challenges could not leave the pedagogical science cold either. It tried to comply with the generation challenges from the very beginning. It tried to “borrow” those technical devices, theories and methods, which were already applied successfully by other fields of science, adjusting its own learning methods, teaching and learning models and learning environments to them. In our article, we try to draw a parallel between the system of engineering and pedagogy. Furthermore, we would like to map the new trends of pedagogy, which are possible on the basis of the logics of engineering.","","978-1-4799-0063-3","10.1109/ICCCyb.2013.6617560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6617560","education;intelligent systems;fuzzy logic","Materials;Education;Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Fuzzy sets;Intelligent systems","","2","","6","IEEE","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578906","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578906","disciplinary competencies;criteria evaluation higher education;educational innovation","Computer science;Training;Technological innovation;Engineering education;Faces","","","","10","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and “blue sky” thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.","","978-1-4673-5855-2","10.1109/EAIS.2013.6604117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6604117","Adaptive critics;computers;computational intelligence;intelligent multi-agents;smart grid","Smart grids;Computational intelligence;Conferences;Computers;Economics;Power system dynamics","","","","95","IEEE","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"WIP: Supporting Student Understanding of Finite Element Analysis and Computational Science: Classroom Scaffolding and ChatGPT","J. L. De La Hoz; D. Restrepo; C. Vieira","Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia; Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas; Department of Education, Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia",2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"26 Feb 2025","2024","","","1","5","This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students' understanding of FEA principles and their ability to translate them into solutions for real-world engineering challenges.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893514","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CAREER 2237313); Army Research Office(grant numbers:W911NF2310192); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893514","Mechanics of materials;computational thinking;threshold concepts;Finite Element Analysis;ChatGPT;Scaffolding","Codes;Scientific computing;Manuals;Transforms;Chatbots;Encoding;Finite element analysis;MATLAB;Programming profession;Stress","","","","24","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Student participants were 11 third graders at one public elementary school in Taiwan. The project in an after-school learning program lasted for five weeks. During weekly learning session, each student needed to use one visual block programming called Ozoblockly to design action patterns for their robots (Ozobot). The study adopted a case study methodology to examine the specific learning scenario. The principal researcher used a participant observation method to observe students' learning behaviors, informal after-class interviews to collect students' learning responses, and a portfolio analysis approach to examine students' programming works. The findings showed that students might obtain a basic understanding of a computer engineer after the instructional intervention. Furthermore, some specific learning patterns from young children's programming process were identified.","","978-1-5386-7764-3","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC.2018.8629609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8629609","K–5 Engineering Education;Educational Robotics;Computational Thinking","Robots;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Training;Task analysis","","6","","15","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
