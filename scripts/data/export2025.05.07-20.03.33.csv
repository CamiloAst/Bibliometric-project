"Facilitating Students’ Abstract and Computational Thinking Skills Using Virtual Reality","X. Wang; D. Saito; H. Washizaki; Y. Fukazawa",Waseda University; Waseda University; Waseda University; Waseda University,2023 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"23 Jan 2024","2023","","","243","246","As Virtual reality (VR) devices become more widespread, they are being recognized as efficient teaching tools for many subjects. In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion. In the post-survey, most participants acknowledge that the immersive environment is helpful when learning abstract subjects.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-0001-7","10.1109/ISEC57711.2023.10402125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10402125","Computer Science Education;Virtual Reality;Tower of Hanoi;Recursion","Computer science;Surveys;Codes;Education;Software algorithms;Virtual reality;Software","","","","8","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drones are framed within real-world contexts, showcasing their applications in multiple industries. Drones offer the possibility to be used to teach programming and coding that promote computational and critical thinking. This research paper presents a pedagogical approach that combines the use of drones with inquiry-based learning to foster students' intellectual, creative, and technical abilities, enhancing their understanding of real-world scenarios and their capacity for critical thinking and problem-solving. The study was conducted in top-end schools in Northern Australia.

Technology is present and permanently impacts our society, including its effects on education. Computational thinking is a way of critically and creatively using the fundamentals of computer science to solve problems, making it essential for success in the job market. This article aims to stimulate computational thinking in children from the first years of elementary school, ranging from the 1 st to the 5 th grades, which corresponds to the age group from 6 to 10 years old. For developing computational thinking in the students, a didactic sequence was created using several tools, namely: naval battle, Blockly Games and the Scratch block programming language. The sequence of artifacts created with Scratch simulates a robot with color sensors, and, as students progress in learning, new challenges are added with the use of sensors, sounds and animations. This project aims to show the importance of computational thinking and encourage teachers to make it increasingly present in the classroom.","","978-1-6654-2358-8","10.1109/LACLO54177.2021.00095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725199","Computational thinking;Scratch;Blockly game","Computer science;Computer languages;Employment;Education;Games;Color;Robot sensing systems","","2","","0","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs. For example, immersive game design may effectively enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. This study is expected to contribute to the development of new approaches in the field of game-based health promotion and treatment.","2573-3060","979-8-3503-8438-3","10.1109/SeGAH61285.2024.10639567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639567","computational thinking;problem-solving;flow state;happiness;subjective well-being;decision making","Analytical models;Correlation;Computational modeling;Games;Mathematical models;Serious games;Problem-solving","","","","11","IEEE","26 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there has been relatively little research shown about how game playing can be associated with the development of computational thinking and how fundamental programming concepts can be supported by playing games. This work investigates how a simulation game should be designed to support the development of computational problem-solving strategies through the medium of learning fundamental computer science concepts, by proposing a theoretical game playing framework.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942991","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942991","computing education;computational problem-solving;game-based learning;Open Sim;Scratch4SL","Games;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Visualization","","7","","25","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
