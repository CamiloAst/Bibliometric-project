Much of these evolutions are incremental, differential and the aim is to sustain or rise above others amidst a dynamic landscape. As data and knowledge bases extend, the fitness of features in each evolution requires systemic modelling targeting multi-objectives. Identification of the local regions of interest and significant features enable more efficient optimization. The information core, current or new invariant features which proceed to the next iteration coupled with gamification in certain domains, can lead to varying implications. This paper briefly reviews literature on associative networks, case-based reasoning, combinations and permutations, optimization, and gamification and conclude with implications and opportunities for symbiotic networks.","2572-7621","978-1-7281-1110-0","10.1109/R10-HTC49770.2020.9356957","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356957","associative networks;optimization;gamification;implications;sustainable design","Symbiosis;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems;Object recognition;Sustainable development;Optimization","","2","","32","IEEE","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information is the core of many engineering fields, such as communications engineering, signal processing, and computational intelligence. Despite its ambient existence in our everyday lives, most of the engineering students are not aware of the connection between information and their professional role as an engineer in the informational world. We seek to engage engineering students in understanding their professional and ethical responsibility, and promote their awareness of the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context. Our study is grounded in the intersection between two theoretical frameworks: (1) Holistic Competencies and (2) William Perry’s scheme of intellectual and ethical development. Having students’ learning evidence against William Perry’s framework and identified students’ cognitive changes along their course study, we suggest that holistic competencies can be fostered through cultivating students’ multifaceted understanding of information and supplementing with real cases where social media serve as a channel for students to exchange ideas to address various global challenges.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028708","holistic competencies;global citizenship;William Perry’s scheme;Information Engineering","Blogs;Social network services;Engineering students;Sustainable development;Knowledge engineering;Big Data","","","","16","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.","","978-1-7281-4401-6","10.1109/SIBIRCON48586.2019.8958329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8958329","creative thinking;creative training;post-task changes;older adults;EEG","","","1","","16","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.","","979-8-3503-3860-7","10.1109/CONIT59222.2023.10205798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10205798","NLP (Natural Language Processing);BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model;Cosine similarity;Creative Index (CI);Squad Dataset;Question Answering model","Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Natural languages;Employment;Transformers;Question answering (information retrieval);Indexes","","","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper concludes with a vision of a new kind of open, networked learning community inhabited by human learners, human experts, and intelligent agents, and suggests ways of evaluating the development of scientific thinking within these communities using a combination of social network and semantic space analysis.","","978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406765","intelligent tutors;animal cognition;epistemic game theory;social capital","Humans;Animals;Cognition;Joints;Social network services;Educational institutions","","1","","30","IEEE","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This prompted us to propose a new forecast method composed of a traffic survey, an artificial transportation system (ATS), and computational experiments. We introduced a BDI modeling method in the agent-based ATS. This method considers an individual's psychological characteristics in combination with logical thinking, which was introduced to individual passenger agents, to deduce each passenger's decision-making process when choosing the traffic mode and route. A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split. Furthermore, the outcomes of various vehicle-scheduling plans were predicted and analyzed by using computational experiments to determine the optimal plan and support the establishment of transportation policies in the real world.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2598252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547907","Agent-based modeling and simulation;belief–desire–intention (BDI) model;computational experiments;traffic distribution forecast;traffic mode choice forecast","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Vehicles;Predictive models;Gravity;Meteorology","","14","","24","IEEE","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
