Throughout Flipped Learning Practices its focus is on initial primary teacher training, designing learning activities and resources to fulfill this challenge of preparing the future teachers to use robotics to release math anxiety. This paper presents an overview of the MindMaths Project and the main ideas underlying its development in the Portuguese context. It frames the more relevant learning issues in primary math education, presents the most significant initiative of programing and robotics in the Portuguese scene and discuss the potential that computational thinking and robotics offer for learning meaningful mathematics in the early years. It also presents a pilot study in a polytechnic school with the participation of 20 students, future teachers, discussing the main ideas of its development and results.","","978-1-6654-7464-1","10.1109/SIIE56031.2022.9982320","Erasmus; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9982320","Mathematics Education;Robotics;Computational Thinking","Training;Computers;Anxiety disorders;Robot sensing systems;Mathematics;Encoding","","","","18","EU","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Teachers' Intention to Integrate Computational Thinking Skills in Higher Education: A Survey Study in the Netherlands","X. Zhang; E. Aivaloglou; M.

While no official policy or teaching framework on CT education has been established in the Netherlands, a Western European country, there have been various initiatives for the integration of CT into the curriculum. Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS. Additionally, there is a call for further exploration of how to enhance teachers' performance expectancy and effort expectancy.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578887","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578887","Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Teachers;Perceptions;UTAUT","Training;Surveys;Computer science;Correlation;Conferences;Europe;Position measurement","","","","36","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Constructing a Computational Thinking Evaluation Framework for Pupils","Y. -S. Su; X. Wang; L.

As a self-report evaluation scale for pupils, this evaluation framework further enriched the CT assessment instruments for pupils and provided a specialized instrument for experts to evaluate pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations during classroom learning. Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages. However, few studies have focused on the specific context from the perspective of practice for pupils. Thus, the evaluation framework of pupils’ CT is worth exploring. Intended Outcomes: A CT evaluation framework for evaluating pupils’ CT in problem-solving situations in classroom learning was constructed to facilitate researchers’ understanding of pupils’ CT levels and problem-solving skills. Application Design: In this study, data from 897 pupils in the fifth and sixth grades were collected using an online questionnaire that included 27 items about CT. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item analysis were conducted to analyze the data in this study, with 17 items remaining in the final evaluation framework. Findings: The fitting validity, convergence validity, and discriminant validity all met the recommended criteria, which showed that the evaluation framework was effective. The total reliability of CT was 0.911, indicating that the consistency and reliability of the evaluation framework constructed in this study were satisfied.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3424423","National Science and Technology Council of Taiwan(grant numbers:NSTC 111-2410-H-019-006-MY3,NSTC 111-2423-H-153-001-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10676315","Classroom learning;computational thinking (CT);evaluation framework;pupils","Instruments;Pupils;Problem-solving;Education;Programming profession;Reliability;Creativity","","","","62","IEEE","11 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The perceiving side of this pair derives from Gibson's (1979) affordance, which is a form of grasping of situations involving perceived objects. This study is part of a new form of evolutionary robotics called cognitive robotics. It considers a new context for a classical form of learning, namely, habitation. The inspiration for the form of affordances described in this paper comes from Heidegger's (1982) notion of the convergence of the concurrent activities of building, dwelling and thinking. In some sense, building and dwelling are at the threshhold of thinking. A brief description of the form and functioning of abstract S-A pairs is given.","1062-922X","0-7803-4053-1","10.1109/ICSMC.1997.633261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=633261","","Robot sensing systems;Cognitive robotics;Actuators;Buildings;Humanoid robots;Artificial intelligence;Computational intelligence;Laboratories;Computer architecture;Intelligent robots","","2","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272507","computing education;computational thinking;gender","Libraries;Color;Cultural differences;Education;Programming profession;Image color analysis;Focusing","","1","","41","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
