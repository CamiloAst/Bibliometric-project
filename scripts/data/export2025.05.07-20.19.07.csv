Robotics-based learning environments are intended to facilitate the learning of programming at the primary level and support developing skills such as collaboration, creativity, and problem-solving thinking in a cross-curricular approach. An Austrian research project focuses on developing and implementing a robotics-based learning environment using the educational design research approach to gain insights into the introduction of computational thinking in primary education. This paper reports on a study to identify preliminary design principles of the learning environment that form the basis of the prototyping cycle of the overall research. Data were collected by interviewing seven experts who have theoretical and practical expertise on educational robotics in primary education. The resulting six preliminary design principles describe the first insight into the design of robotics-based learning environments.","2473-9464","978-1-6654-1468-5","10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569250","design principles;computational thinking;educational robotics;primary school","Education;Collaboration;Problem-solving;Robots;Programming profession;Creativity","","1","","43","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This proposal seeks to guarantee the possibility of assimilating learning between lines and between years of study, guaranteeing connectivity between the teaching teams of the interdisciplinary faculty, between the lines of the curriculum, and between students, inside and outside their formal studies and the classroom. In this way, we provide not only the development of technical skills but also contemplate one of the significant challenges in engineering education, which is the development of socially relevant engineering curricula, thus strengthening the intrinsic motivation and adaptability of the student. In the face of the ongoing transformations in the engineering field - especially considering the rise of Industry 4.0 - professionals in this area must get an inter and trans disciplinary education, in close touch with society and industry needs. This calls for educational practices that stimulate entrepreneur development, dynamical skills, and traditional technical knowledge. In this work, we propose the 4D CV framework based on hybrid teaching and new trends in teaching and learning based on active methodologies, seeking to train a future professional who acts as an active agent in society, capable of facing the challenges of Engineering in the 21st century. We create learning environments that allow for (i) the development of capacity and motivation for teamwork in a technical, multi, and interdisciplinary way; (ii) a creative environment aiming for a comprehensive education along with entrepreneurial spirit and ability to innovate; (iii) reflection and discussion that favor independent critical thinking; (iv) actions that strengthen the university's relationship with the local community allowing closer relation with society and the productive sector. The proposed framework was the subject of a case study applied in the discipline of Curricular Integration Activities IV, of the undergraduate course in Automation Engineering of a Federal University of Brazil, where the technique of the Discourse of the Collective Subject (DCS) to capture the impression of those involved in the study (students, teachers and partner companies). It was possible that the practices of the proposed curriculum project could provide students with inter and multidisciplinarity in their learning process. In addition, students have been motivated in the face of involvement with the needs of society, achieved through practice in an innovative project in which the challenge was based on the real pains/demands/needs of a real startup company, formed by graduates of the course itself, already established in the market. We can thus conclude not only the tremendous innovative potential of our curricular proposal in the face of the significant challenges in engineering education but also its innovative character in approaches to higher education in Brazil.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893190","enginnering;curriculum;extension;project","Industries;Technological innovation;Entrepreneurship;Companies;Market research;Reflection;Teamwork;Proposals;Engineering education;Faces","","","","20","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to this demand, a pedagogical activity was developed and executed to facilitate students in applying ethical theories to occupational and societal challenges while enhancing their critical thinking abilities. This activity involves students participating in a debate where they are assigned a moral stance to uphold and must utilize one of the ethical theories explored in class to bolster their case. This paper offers an in-depth account of the conception and execution of this educational activity, as well as the encouraging results observed. Furthermore, the paper showcases the scenario utilized in the activity, which outlines a professional conundrum in the realm of Computer Engineering. The findings of this educational activity indicate its efficacy as a teaching instrument for ethics in engineering programs, with potential applicability to other engineering fields. By integrating such pedagogical activities into engineering programs, educators can empower students with essential ethical values and skills to tackle intricate ethical issues in their professional and social spheres while also fostering critical thinking and encouraging dialogue among students.","1932-8540","","10.1109/RITA.2024.3368609","Departament de Recerca i Universitats de la Generalitat de Catalunya - 2021(grant numbers:SGR 01412); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443691","Computer ethics;critical thinking;ethics in engineering;didactical resource","Ethics;Education;Codes;Law;Informatics;Computer science;Engineering education;Philosophical considerations","","","","26","CCBY","22 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Its main contribution is its more rigorous treatment/control group research design that allows testing for causal influences of CCEs on student learning and performance. Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2018.2804350","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:0829647,1431874,1122956); UNL Phase II Pathways to Interdisciplinary Research Centers grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303219","Achievement;computational creativity;computer science;CS1;evidence-based practice;self-efficacy","Creativity;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Tools;Teamwork;Computer science","","15","","29","IEEE","27 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We discuss three key kinds of coping, Wishful Thinking, Resignation and Distancing that impact an agent's beliefs, intentions and desires, and compare these coping responses to related work in the attitude change literature. We discuss the EMA computational model of emotion and identify several hypotheses it makes concerning these coping processes. We assess these hypotheses against the behavior of human subjects playing a competitive board game, using monetary gains and losses to induce emotion and coping. Subject's appraisals, emotional state and coping responses were indexed at key points throughout a game, revealing a pattern of subject's al-tering their beliefs, desires and intentions as the game unfolds. The results clearly support several of the hypotheses on coping responses but also identify (a) extensions to how EMA models Wishful Thinking as well as (b) individual differences in subject's coping responses.","2156-8111","978-1-4244-4800-5","10.1109/ACII.2009.5349584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5349584","","Computational modeling;Humans;Game theory;Appraisal;Cognition;Predictive models;Intelligent robots;Psychology;Economic forecasting;Decision making","","12","","29","IEEE","8 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a single decision on an object parameter or parameter group in a product structure may be influenced by several humans, humans are strictly responsible for their decisions. The only way is development of transparent intelligent engineering procedures those are capable for representation of humans. The above features of engineering tasks do not allow application of closed procedures from the conventional knowledge engineering and computational intelligence. The authors are engaged in application of knowledge based methods in intelligent engineering. This paper starts with purposeful characterizing of intelligent engineering features in current industrial product modeling systems. Following this, it discusses possibilities for adding intelligence to current product modeling processes. An earlier proposed method by the authors in modeling of human intent driven engineering objectives and contextual connections as entities to assist decisions is applied. Finally, the authors propose a possible way to capture human thinking process element in order to establish intelligent content in product models. The starting point of the proposed modeling is current modeling functionality of industrial product lifecycle management systems widely applied in aircraft, car, house appliance and other industries.","1543-9259","978-1-4244-7652-7","10.1109/INES.2010.5483869","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5483869","","Competitive intelligence;Humans;Computational intelligence;Knowledge engineering;Aerospace industry;Intelligent systems;Systems engineering and theory;Context modeling;Aircraft;Home appliances","","1","","12","IEEE","14 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) might represent a possible solution. We therefore designed and developed a MOOC (called “LOOP: Learning Object-Oriented Programming”) which provides a gentle introduction to computational thinking and object-oriented concepts before the programming part. In addition to the common quizzes, we developed various we-based interactive exercises to enable the learners to experiment and interact directly with the presented concepts. Furthermore, we implemented programming exercises with constructive feedback for the learners using a web-based integrated development environment and additionally an automatic grading system. The target group of the course are prospective students of science or engineering that are due to attend CS lessons in their first terms. The course was conducted as a prototype with a limited number of participants. In a concluding survey, the participants submitted textual feedback on the course; some of them proposed specific improvements for the employed interactive exercises. Yet, the overall feedback was encouragingly positive. In this paper, we describe the design and the development of the course, as well as our initial results.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943079","Computer science education;Courseware;Education courses;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Self-study courses;STEM","Programming profession;Videos;Tools;Object oriented programming;Education;Java","","14","","26","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
