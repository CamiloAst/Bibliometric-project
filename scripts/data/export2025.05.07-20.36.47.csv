"Turning datasets into patient-centered knowledge utilities","R. Bahati; F.

Through information visualization tools, we aim to provide feedback to patients to encourage behavior change. The system has two core building blocks: (1) Data analysis combining several statistical and machine learning models, founded under different principles and assumptions, into a single meta-model for predicting compliance behavior. The aim is to create superior models for behavior prediction - knowledge that can then be translated into patient-centered decision-support tools. (2) Incorporating data analysis and visualization enabling datasets to be turned into knowledge utilities that can intelligently interact with participants by alerting them to any interesting correlations within the data. Such tools could provide feedback indicating, for example, a high-risk to medication non-compliance behavior in which case appropriate resources could be directed to those who need help the most.","1063-7125","978-1-4799-1053-3","10.1109/CBMS.2013.6627876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6627876","","Diabetes;Predictive models;Data visualization;Data analysis;Diseases;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling","","","","9","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836171","music composition;computer science principles;student engagement;culture;STEAM","Music;Encoding;Education;Computer science;Interviews;Cultural differences;Computational modeling","","2","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach can work with input factors, for which sharp limits cannot be defined and it can handle uncertainties, subjectivity in the data as well as the evaluation process. The conventional Mamdani inference is the most suitable method, because it helps to build a model, which is much closer to human thinking, but its computational needs are very high, due to the complex-shape functions. This paper introduces a flexible patient monitoring system optimization, where the input functions can be tuned according to the personal statistics. Modified versions of the Mamdani inference are applied in this system, which can reduce computational complexity, while they retain the advantages of the original method.","1949-0488","978-1-5386-6841-2","10.1109/SISY.2018.8524744","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8524744","","Computational modeling;Firing;Fuzzy sets;Risk management;Gravity;Mathematical model;Patient monitoring","","","","9","IEEE","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The mathematical nature of perception and cognition turn out to be very similar. The developed mathematical technique is practically useful for engineering designs and also corresponds to our intuition about our psyche. The paper establishes relationships between the developed mathematical techniques, classical semiotic concepts of sign and symbol, and more general notions of symbol in culture and psychology. An important and psychologically loaded notion of symbol refers to psychic processes connecting conscious and unconscious representations (concepts and archetypes). I analyze the elementary thinking process and discuss which aspects of this process are available to consciousness. This leads to a suggestion that the mathematical nature of the symbol process is similar to the perception-cognition process. Thus, thinking-process and symbol-process are same: a vortex of emotions, models-archetypes, and sensory data. This vortex brings forth into consciousness the previously unconscious contents of mind, which improve our understanding of the world.","2158-9860","0-7803-4423-5","10.1109/ISIC.1998.713830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713830","","Psychology;Artificial intelligence;Intelligent systems;Cognition;Design engineering;Joining processes;Cultural differences;Adaptive systems;Potential well;Intelligent networks","","2","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3325992","Covenant Applied Informatics and Communication Africa Centre of Excellence (CApIC-ACE), domiciled at Covenant University with the ACE Impact Grant from the World Bank through the National University Commission, Nigeria; Covenant University Center for Research, Innovation, and Discovery (CUCRID), Covenant University; Google TensorFlow College Outreach Award through a machine learning workshop session based on this project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287938","Blockchain;intrusion detection;deep learning;recurrent neural network","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Security;Monitoring;Servers;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks","","4","","58","CCBYNCND","19 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It takes the problem-solving and the live code as the main teaching line, takes the information technology teaching as the means, promotes the students’ integration of the theory and practice by the ACM/ICPC competition, and organically combines the process assessment and the final assessment, and implements the diversified assessment forms. For theoretical teaching, the authors put forward an innovative model of C++ teaching based on the concept of the OBE and the combination of the ACM competition and teaching. For practical teaching, the authors designed a keyword-oriented OJ system to address the problem of the large differences in the programming ability among the students. For the course assessment, the authors designed a C++ multi-topic intelligent online examination system. The results of more than ten years’ practical teaching show that the innovative model of the C++ teaching based on the OBE concept and the ACM competition has effectively cultivated the students’ computational thinking and significantly improved their programming ability and innovation ability. In the past ten years, our students won many ACM/ICPC prizes. At present, this teaching innovation model has been effectively promoted and applied in three campuses of our university. It has a certain leading and exemplary role in cultivating the top-notch innovative talents in the field of the computer science with the excellent professional programming ability, computational thinking, the national sentiment, the global vision and the all-round development.","2474-3828","979-8-3503-5667-0","10.1109/ITME63426.2024.00161","South China University of Technology; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10935485","OBE (Outcome-Based Education);ACM/ICPC;C++;teaching innovative model","Technological innovation;Codes;Computational modeling;Education;C++ languages;Problem-solving;Information technology;Programming profession","","","","12","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
