Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.","","978-1-61284-840-2","10.1109/ICCRD.2011.5764273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5764273","computer-assist teaching;integration;interactive learning environment;constructivism","Computational modeling;Computers;Educational institutions;Biological system modeling;Internet;Context","","","","6","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637147","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637147","Computer Science;Computational Thinking;Citizen Science;Ontology","Computer science;Vocabulary;Visualization;Computational modeling;Conferences;Education;Collaboration","","","","33","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.","","979-8-3503-0336-0","10.1109/CISCT57197.2023.10351460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10351460","Artificial Intelligence;Diabetic retinopathy;Machine learning;hemorrhages;neovascularization","Diabetic retinopathy;Computational modeling;Visual impairment;Programming;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Ophthalmology","","","","19","IEEE","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
