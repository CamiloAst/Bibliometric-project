Utilizing Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we examined interaction behaviors and cognitive development in a foundational computer science course. Data were collected from a Chinese university over nine weeks, involving two experimental phases. The analysis categorized students into core and peripheral groups based on centrality metrics, revealing significant differences in their engagement and learning levels. Core group members demonstrated higher cognitive development and problem-solving abilities, with dense connections in higher-order cognitive stages. In contrast, peripheral group members showed limited interaction and basic cognitive outcomes. The findings emphasize the critical role of collaboration and communication in fostering Deeper Learning, suggesting the need for educational institutions to adopt new teaching methods and technologies. By promoting high-order cognition and collaborative learning, educators can enhance students' critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills, ultimately contributing to a dynamic and enriched learning environment.","","979-8-3503-7694-4","10.1109/ICET62460.2024.10869241","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10869241","Online Collaborative Knowledge Construction;Deeper Learning;SNA;ENA;Computational Thinking","Knowledge engineering;Measurement;Computer science;Technological innovation;Social networking (online);Federated learning;Collaboration;Network analyzers;Educational technology;Problem-solving","","","","13","IEEE","6 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273915","Computational Thinking;DDA;Active Methodologies;Education 4.0;Teaching Programming","Education;Programming profession;Software;Tools;Pattern recognition;Parallel processing;Hardware","","3","","20","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. In this paper, we investigated what is the Greek Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ understanding and awareness as far as Computational Thinking is concerned. Since teachers are the agents of change, it is critical to find out how familiar and/or skilled they are with the Computational Thinking notion. Thus, we applied a qualitative questionnaire all over the whole Greek State where 406 teachers answered. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the teacher’s readiness, as well as more generic aspects according to their profile and faculty.","","979-8-3503-9958-5","10.1109/PACET56979.2022.9976359","European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976359","computational thinking;teachers;curriculum;skills;education","Training;Telecommunications;Problem-solving;Programming profession","","1","","34","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although it is still a poorly understood subject speculative ideas about brain processes involved in creative thinking may be implemented in computational models. A review of different approaches to creativity, insight and intuition is presented. Two factors are essential for creativity: imagination and selection or filtering. Imagination should be constrained by experience, while filtering in the case of creative use of words may be based on semantic and phonological associations. Analysis of brain processes involved in invention of new words leads to practical algorithms that create many interesting and novel names associated with a set of keywords.","2161-4407","0-7803-9490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716125","","Logic;Psychology;Computational intelligence;Humans;Brain modeling;Filtering;Computational modeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Competitive intelligence;Motor drives","","11","","52","IEEE","30 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2017.2734818","Region of Madrid(grant numbers:S2013/ICE-2715); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7999170","Programming;computational thinking;learning paths;data-driven;Scratch","Programming profession;Tools;Education;Games;Computational modeling","","34","","43","IEEE","1 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The lack of clear definition makes assessment tool challenging to formulate, pedagogical efforts difficult to compare, and research difficult to synthesize. This paper looks to operationalize differing definitions of CT enhancing the ability to teach then assess the presence of CT. Expanding upon CT definitions, industry practices and processes, and educational theory, we link existing concepts and propose a new element to model an active definition of CT as a theoretical framework to guide future research. Our model updates existing CT definition by formally including Modeling, introducing Socio-Technical processes, separating Information Gathering from Data Collection and adding emphasis to Testing as a vital CT concept. We feel these elements and interconnections make CT is easier to describe and measure.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190682","Abstraction;Computational Thinking;Modeling;Testing;Debugging","Computational modeling;Computers;Programming profession;Education;Gravity;Tools","","7","","27","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The methodology focuses on the phases of the SCRUM development process. The results show that women perceive less difficulty in understanding the activities to be solved.
