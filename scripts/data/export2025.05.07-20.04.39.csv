The typical design method of CAM pitch curve is based on the principle of inversion [2], [3]. In the process of designing CAM, the author uses creative thinking [4] to raise the question whether the design steps based on the inversion principle can be applied ""in reverse"". Based on this problem, the author takes the plate CAM mechanism with translating knife-edge follower as an example and verifies the design results of CAM pitch curve through two different motion curves. The results show that the inverse application on the principle of the inversion method does not change the CAM pitch curve.","2473-3547","979-8-3503-1745-9","10.1109/ISCID59865.2023.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494259","CAM design;inverse thinking;motion curve","Employee welfare;Technological innovation;Design methodology;Computational intelligence","","","","6","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to have good knowledge, students should be able to learn independently. This study proposes Codify, a programming learning tool or e-learning platform for students where they are able to independently use several types of questions, including multiple choices, drop-down, drag-anddrop, and blank code. If students are not able to answer correctly, the system will recommend similar cases. For this study, the researchers applied the design thinking method to create a prototype of Codify to ensure that students who use it have a good user experience. Out of six scales in the user experience questionnaire (UEQ), five scales (Attractiveness, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, and Novelty) are included in the Excellent category, while one scale (Perspicuity) is included in the Good category, meaning the Codify prototype has an excellent user experience with a slight improvement.","2472-7555","979-8-3315-0526-4","10.1109/CICN63059.2024.10847445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10847445","design thinking method;user experience questionnaire (UEQ);programming learning tools;e-learning","Computer languages;Electronic learning;Codes;Prototypes;Programming;Benchmark testing;User experience;Communication networks;Computational intelligence","","","","18","IEEE","27 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is known that students are difficult to understand it. Therefore, this study focuses on developing an application, called computational story, to teach the subject of algorithm and programming with the problem-posing approach and story problems. To achieve this goal, a model that considers the following aspects: basic structure in programming in C language, case studies, and choice of answer categories, is built. Then, an experimental research was conducted in a school to be seen to improve the students' understanding of algorithm and programming. The results obtained indicate that there is an increase in students' understanding, and this application can be used also to assess the critical thinking level of students in the future work.","","978-1-5386-8050-6","10.1109/EIConCIT.2018.8878556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8878556","problem posing;learning model;critical thinking;computational story","Computational modeling;Programming profession;Graphical user interfaces;Information technology;Computer science education","","","","15","IEEE","24 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The promotion of critical thinking, however, remains largely unaddressed within the field of educational robotics. To address this gap and question if and how robots can be used to promote critical thinking in young children's education, we conducted an explorative design study named Bringing Shybo Home. Through this study, in which a robot was used as a springboard for debate with twenty 8- to 9-year-old children at school, we exemplify how the deceptive nature of robots, if embraced and magnified in order for it to become explicitly controversial, can be used to nurture children's critical mindset.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889511","deception;societal impact;critical thinking;design exploration;educational robotics","Ethics;Social robots;Education;Faces","","6","","66","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
