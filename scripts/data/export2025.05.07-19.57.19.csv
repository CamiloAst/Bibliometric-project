The target problem is the lack of a robust, scalable, and automated method to analyze computational thinking skills from source code written by elementary school students. The proposed method uses a variety of techniques to assess student responses, including analyzing the programming structure, programming correctness, and code execution based on certain parameters defined during the exercise specification. Analysis of the source code and evaluation of the answers to the exercises are carried out using high performance computing to improve the response time of the system. This preliminary work will contribute to a robust method for automated exam scoring, which is expected to assess and support the development of computational thinking among students.","","979-8-3503-2759-5","10.1109/CSCE60160.2023.00181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487449","Automatic evaluation;computational thinking;source code analysis;abstract syntax trees","Codes;Source coding;High performance computing;Prototypes;Cloning;Programming;Syntactics","","","","19","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cultivation of students’ CT skills posed a challenge, often involving the introduction of abstract and challenging-to-visualize programming concepts. This study aimed to bridge this gap by introducing an augmented reality-based coding game—an interactive learning platform designed to facilitate students in acquiring programming skills and enhancing their grasp of computational thinking concepts. The augmented reality (AR) digital game is specifically directed towards fundamental CT skills, such as pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, and developing algorithms. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AR game in enhancing CT skills, a study was conducted with 124 middle school students, entailing in grades 6th and 8th. The experimental group (N = 63) utilized the AR game, while the control group (N = 61) relied on conventional text materials. The findings of the experiment strongly supported the integration of AR technology along with game-based learning as a means to enhance CT knowledge and skills while simultaneously reducing cognitive load.","2161-377X","979-8-3503-6205-3","10.1109/ICALT61570.2024.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645865","Augmented reality;computational thinking;game-based learning;cognitive load","Codes;Education;Games;Writing;Cognitive load;Encoding;Pattern recognition","","","","26","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Assessing Computational Thinking Pedagogy in Serious Games Through Questionnaires, Think-aloud Testing, and Automated Data Logging","J. R.

Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning. It concludes with a potential use case to demonstrate how the methods can be combined to achieve a granular and actionable understanding of a complex CT assessment problem and its causes.","","978-1-7281-7679-6","10.1109/ICISFall51598.2021.9627365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627365","serious games;game;gaming;computational thinking;algorithmic thinking;test;testing;assessment;development","Software testing;Information science;Bibliographies;Education;Games;Manuals;Tools","","1","","23","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through three rounds of action research, the essay investigated the impact of teaching interaction strategies on the development of students' computational thinking.

The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.","","978-1-4799-9967-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126261","Computing Curriculum;K-12 education;Computational Thinking;Delphi Survey","Computational modeling;Analytical models;Data models;Computers;Education;Computer science;Standards","","12","","4","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in practical pedagogical applications, specific educational models and implementations are highly dependent on exceptional teachers with innovative abilities, especially in the cultivation of implicit higher-order thinking of students still lacking a better landing point. In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability.
