This paper designs and implements a No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning. During the game, MCTS algorithm is used to explore the legal situation under the current situation. In this process, the convolutional neural network is used to evaluate the explored situation. Then, the neural network is trained to evaluate the situation with the results of the match, so as to achieve the effect of self-improving algorithm without human experience. In addition, the author used the Union-Find to find the legal landing point on the chessboard. Finally, the experiment shows that this type of No-Go algorithm based on reinforcement learning can be improved by itself and reach a certain level of chess ability, which improves the efficiency of searching legal moves compared with the traditional No-Go chessboard traversal method.","","978-1-7281-5209-7","10.1109/IUCC/DSCI/SmartCNS.2019.00147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8982615","Computer Chess;No-Go;MCTS;Reinforcement Learning;Union-Find","","","2","","10","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the emergence of Semantic Web framework the naïve approach of searching information on the syntactic web is cliché. Why do we think that the web would be improved, if it understood the meaning of its contents? Doesn't it understand it now? Google is very good at correcting typing mistakes, figuring out what I “meant” when I miss-typed a query or suggesting keyword to expand our search query. In this paper we redefine the idea of searching optimised information on the web using Capture-Recapture method. This paper also explains an optimised semantic searching of keywords and detailed explanation and simulation on Ontology of Indian Universities.","","978-1-4244-5967-4","10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705783","Semantic Query;Ontology;XML;Keyword Searching;Optimisation;Capture-Recapture Method","Ontologies;Statistics;Sociology;Semantics;Resource description framework;XML;OWL","","1","","13","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study needs to comprehend how awareness and freedom are formed in these frameworks. However, one of the challenges facing computer education studies is incorporating artificial intelligence and classical mathematical thinking into the school curriculum. Research on how individuals learn to prepare, evaluate, enhance, and implement machine learning systems is lacking, particularly in the K–12 educational area, despite machine learning's pivotal role in today's technology. This article places current research in the computing learning setting. Outlines variations that K–12 computing instructors should consider when tackling this obstacle, and graphs arising pathways in educational reality, concept, and innovation related to instructing machine learning in schools in grades K–12. To properly include ML in the more comprehensive K–12 computer curriculum, the paper focuses on significant aspects of the perspective shift.","","979-8-3315-0868-5","10.1109/ICPCT64145.2025.10940750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10940750","Machine Learning (ML);K–12 Education;Artificial Intelligence (AI);Pedagogy;Technology","Technological innovation;Ethics;Computer aided instruction;Machine learning","","","","17","IEEE","1 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For many simple control objects, PID control could easily achieve perfect effect, but for some complex object the effect is not so perfect. The submarine maneuver control system is a nonlinear six degree of freedom model, which has the great inertia variational parameters and many other complex characters. It is difficult for single PID to control the system because of the complex characters. In many instances, the best control is obtained in the manual mode using experienced operators. Fuzzy control translates the thinking of experienced operators into control algorithm, which has proven effective for complex, nonlinear, imprecisely-defined model. In order to advance the control effect, fuzzy theory is introduced and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The result shows that fuzzy PID control designed for the unstable nonlinear model of submarine maneuver respond more rapidly and robustly than single PID control.","","978-1-4673-1744-3","10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6463199","","PD control;Underwater vehicles;Niobium;Fuzzy control;Mathematical model;Equations","","","","6","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Corresponding to this demand, many universities offer the curriculum of public psychology. However, traditional teaching of public psychology makes students feel it very difficult to understand and think psychology is not useful in reality. In order to change the situation, we produce a cooperative-learning model based on network for public psychology in university. This teaching mode involves a series of procedures, that is, fixing on study units and objectives, organizing learning groups for cooperative study, constructing web study environment, monitoring and guiding throughout the study process, providing feedback and appraisal for cooperative learning as well. In a word, with the tools of e-mail, ICQ, QQ, BBS, the cooperative-model in public psychology based on web helps to facilitate students' communication with one another, stretch space-time of traditional classroom, and promote resources sharing.","","978-1-4244-4507-3","10.1109/CISE.2009.5363135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5363135","","Psychology;Education;Educational institutions;Collaboration;Educational technology;Instruments;Computer networks;Sociology;Organizing;Monitoring","","","","8","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes machine learning based fast reading algorithm to identify elements of an important story that are handed down in spite of temporal and spatial differences using the version of 72 similar folk tales of the folk tales ""Red Hat"" which exist in Europe, Asia, Africa etc. To do this, we analyze the factors depending on the existence of various versions in a decision tree and conduct research using R language tree and caret package. Through the evaluation of the analytical model, we confirmed the existence of the unchanging core elements of traditional talks, which are handed down to the constraints of time and space, and the possibility of a model that intuitively understands them.
