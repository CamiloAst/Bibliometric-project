There are various kind of computing technologies to make shapes, pictures and signs for artistic activities, that be generated by algorithmic programme. In series of ideas are made by computing thinking, extending perceive for expression. There are three form of creation, which code as translator between perceive (see, hear...) and performance. The paper conclude that educators could apply artistic activities through computing thinking to extend the range of materials and spirits of inquiry by applying technologies in creation.","","978-1-5386-5059-2","10.1109/IC3.2018.00-44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567182","art;computational thinking;STEAM education","Art;Painting;Software;Visualization;Education;Music","","","","18","IEEE","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"DWES: A Dynamic Weighted Evaluation System for Scratch based on Computational Thinking","X. Chai; Y. Sun; H. Luo; M.

Since Scratch projects are rich in multimedia resources, it can be time-consuming to judge them by hand, requiring manual execution with the understanding of each project. Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2020.3044588","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2100300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61877005,61772085); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321708","Scratch;computational thinking;evaluation system;dynamic weighted","Tools;Sprites (computer);Manuals;Games;Computer languages;Complexity theory;Programming profession","","7","","36","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the current research on CT assessment is mostly single-approach, which is not effective in accurately measuring numerous competencies of CT skills and has the disadvantage of assessment limitation. In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives. And the approach of evaluating CT skills from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives can reflect learners' CT skills more comprehensively and accurately.","","978-1-6654-7551-8","10.1109/ICEIT57125.2023.10107885","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107885","computational thinking;text-based programming;assessment tool;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis","Current measurement;Education;Information technology;Programming profession","","","","23","IEEE","28 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g. through modeling we could ""kill two birds with one stone"": On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education. Besides best practices, it further presents some experiences and results gained from teacher observation, interviews and informal feedback from students and teachers.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363469","computational thinking;modeling;education;language learning","Computational modeling;Unified modeling language;Education;Object oriented modeling;Conferences;Problem-solving","","14","","23","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several tools have been reported in the literature to support the development of computational thinking. This paper reports a Systematic Literature Review to present the characteristics that have made successful web systems that support the development of computational thinking in recent years and the reported limitations. Eighteen primary studies were selected where the strategies used are usually learning through lessons, practicing with exercises, working through games, and using feedback. The systems found have been used at different elementary, middle, high school, and bachelor's degree levels. Finally, the main limitations reported in using these systems were mainly the difficulty of the topics, the previous knowledge that the students should have, the attitude that the students showed and the lack of motivation. Finally, we make some recommendations to software engineering curriculum planners and programming teachers about systems for developing computational thinking.","","979-8-3503-2883-7","10.1109/CONISOFT58849.2023.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10568269","Computational thinking;web system;Learning;Software Engineering;students","Technological innovation;Systematics;Bibliographies;Games;Programming;Software engineering","","","","29","IEEE","27 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
