The tool is a Visual Programming Language; the algorithms are formed by block-assembly, thereby solving one of the students' main problems, which are ""syntax errors"". In addition, the tool brings with it a set of level-ordered challenges aimed at teaching students basic principles of programming and logic (sequential programming, repetitive and conditional control structure), where at each level the student will learn the different concepts and behaviors of computational thinking. For the evaluations with the users we counted on the participation of 18 students between 12 and 15 years old coming from two public institutions of Rio de Janeiro. In these evaluations it was also considered to measure the sensation of immersion through Telepresence, Social Presence and Usability.","","978-1-7281-0382-2","10.1109/LACLO.2018.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8783611","Computational thinking, virtual reality, programming in education, introduction to programming, programming and games, programming and virtual reality","Connectors;Programming profession;Visualization;Tools;Virtual reality;Two dimensional displays","","2","","","IEEE","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MVMDP is a generalization of partially observable Markov decision process, and reflects an important characteristic of human thought: that people, under the possibility that they grasp the whole states (i.e., appropriately measure the state space), think of problems and can choose their own optimal actions. So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems. We believe this work is helpful for further development of artificial intelligence.","","978-1-5386-2165-3","10.1109/FSKD.2017.8393054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8393054","Measure-Valued Branching Processes;Measure-Valued Markov Decision Processes;Partially observable Markov Decision Processes","Markov processes;Probability distribution;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Decision making;Artificial intelligence;Parallel processing","","","","8","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process. Further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ML in form-giving. The implication is not only in sharpening the tools of product form-giving but also in rethinking the theories of industrial design.","","978-1-6654-3318-1","10.1109/ECEI53102.2022.9829452","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829452","industrial design;product design;learning motivation;computational thinking","Industries;Deep learning;Technological innovation;Conferences;Best practices;Image classification","","","","21","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.","","978-1-6654-6708-7","10.1109/CEC55065.2022.9870296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870296","imperialist competitive algorithm;computational thinking;double assimilation;prosperity and destruction of empires;population redistribution;elite opposition-based learning;differential evolution operator;partitioning and clustering","Heuristic algorithms;Sociology;Clustering algorithms;Robustness;Partitioning algorithms;Statistics;Particle swarm optimization","","1","","20","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a container terminal gang scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with intensive computational experiments.","","978-1-4799-8697-2","10.1109/SMC.2015.241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379373","container terminal logistics system;computational thinking;parallel computing;multiprocessor system-on-chip;gang scheduling;processor affinity;load balancing","Load management;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Conferences;Cybernetics;Logistics","","3","","10","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Game-Based Assessment for Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review","Q. Luo; S. Zhang",Macao Polytechnic University; Macao Polytechnic University,2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"17 Sep 2024","2024","","","01","08","Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-5280-1","10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664854","computational thinking;systematic review;game-based assessment;STEM education","Cognitive processes;Current measurement;Education;Focusing;Games;Manuals;Encoding","","","","32","IEEE","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658913","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658913","Mathematical Modeling;Computational Thinking;Data Science;web log analytics","Data models;Portals;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Data mining;Conferences","","3","","16","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
