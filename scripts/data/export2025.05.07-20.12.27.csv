This paper explores how AI can enhance STEAM education for K-12 students, preparing them for a rapidly evolving digital world. A review of current literature demonstrates that AI technologies, including virtual reality, augmented reality, machine learning, and IoT, can revolutionize both teaching and learning by promoting critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. AI-driven tools like ChatGPT, learning analytics, and chatbots provide personalized learning experiences, making education more interactive and engaging. The paper also highlights AI's role in fostering inclusivity and bridging gender gaps within STEAM, particularly in arts education. Furthermore, the paper examines the challenges of AI integration, such as teacher readiness, trust in technology, and the need for professional development. The findings underscore AI's potential to empower educators and students alike, suggesting a roadmap for AI-enhanced STEAM education aligned with sustainable development goals. This research advocates for incorporating AI literacy in curricula to equip students with essential skills for the future.","","979-8-3315-0868-5","10.1109/ICPCT64145.2025.10940569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10940569","Artificial Intelligence;STEAM Education;K-12 Education;IoT in Education; Personalized Learning;Critical Thinking;AI Literacy;Teacher Readiness","Training;Ethics;Education;Learning (artificial intelligence);Transforms;Chatbots;Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence;Sustainable development;Creativity","","","","14","IEEE","1 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis of new data obtained from neurology, psychology philosophy and anthropology allows us to generate a mapping of monoamine neuro modulators and to apply it to computational system parameters.

Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274230","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274230","research-to-practice;outreach program design;design thinking;computational thinking;backward design;Next Generation STEM;pracademic approach","Games;Computational modeling;Statistics;Sociology;Education;Recruitment;STEM","","1","","34","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution. The advancement of deep learning algorithms can potentially help improve lung cancer detection with low-dose CT scans.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2020.3027744","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01CA187013); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1452211,1553680,1723529); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01LM012601); Arkansas Biosciences Institute(grant numbers:#200144); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:P20GM103429); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209148","Lung cancer screening;low-dose CT scan;deep learning algorithm;convolutional neural network (CNN);medical imaging","Cancer;Computed tomography;Lung;Biological system modeling;Training;Testing;Machine learning","Algorithms;Early Detection of Cancer;Humans;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","16","","25","IEEE","29 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
