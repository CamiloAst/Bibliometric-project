To arrive at the optimal arrangement of a collection, archivists rely on some item-level processing or knowledge gained by exploring and manipulating digital reproductions of the contents. In this paper we consider archival student and instructor perspectives from hands-on course experiences directly with two distinct collections: one pertaining to the development, 2017 transfer and launch, and ongoing maintenance of the International Research Portal for Records Related to Nazi-Era Cultural Property (IRP2), and one a selection of unclassified catalog entries about digitized nuclear science reports. Visualizing is a data practice that permits the discovery of key content patterns, identification of computational models to be carried out to aid further analysis, and query-resolution for subject experts with precise - and historically significant - research questions. While archival data visualizations have previously been implemented as an extension of descriptive work including finding aid element counts, here we connect visualization to the work of archival outreach and access. We study how visualizations generated by groups of students working with textual and numerical dataset portions can ultimately accelerate time-sensitive uses of collections.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386566","National Archives and Records Administration; University of Maryland; Institute of Museum and Library Services; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386566","computational thinking;information science education;information visualization;provenance research;data transformation","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Data visualization;Maintenance engineering;Big Data;Data models;Cultural differences","","","","48","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our CPACE (Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering Workforce Needs) vision is to revitalize undergraduate computing education within the engineering and technology fields. Our objective is to design and implement a process to engage stakeholders from multiple sectors and identify the computational tools and problem-solving skills and define how these skills-directly informed by industry needs-can be integrated across disciplinary curricula. By explicitly integrating computing concepts and disciplinary problem solving, engineering graduates will enter the workforce with improved and practice-ready computational thinking that will enhance their problem-solving and design skills. We present the analysis of the computational skills and the strategies that we are using to map the workforce problem-solving requirements onto the foundational computer science principles. We outline the framework that we are using to identify opportunities for curricular integration between computer science concepts and the disciplinary engineering curricula. By documenting, evaluating, and making the process explicit, this process can serve as a model for national efforts to strengthen undergraduate computing education in engineering.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350463","CPACE;Computing education in engineering;Engineering curricular reform","Computer science;Computer science education;Collaborative work;Problem-solving;Knowledge engineering;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Computer vision;Educational technology;Computer industry","","16","","6","IEEE","8 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main contribution of the reported work to product modeling is a dialogue input and model representation of human intent in order to make assistance for human who applies product model and needs important details from thinking process of human whom decision must be considered. The proposed method enforces human intent based definition of engineering objects. In order to achieve this, human intent representation is used at definition of engineering objectives for definition of engineering objects while contextual connections amongst intents, objectives and decisions, and amongst these entities and engineering objects are also considered. Consequences of changes of engineering objects are tracked along change chains in the change affect zones of the changed engineering objects. This modeling constitutes a new extension to classical product modeling and is placed between the human and the current information based product model in order to establish an efficient and coordinated control of engineering object parameters.","","978-1-4244-4477-9","10.1109/SACI.2009.5136237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136237","","Humans;Knowledge engineering;Engineering management;Performance analysis;Shape;Computational intelligence;Informatics;Systems engineering and theory;Decision making;Production planning","","","","13","IEEE","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To counter this, we devised a form of structured pseudocode, designed to highlight and facilitate algorithmic construction so that the complexities of the programming language can be deferred until proficiency in design has been reached. Students taught with this experimental approach are not introduced to the language itself, or the compiler, until the last few weeks of the semester. A controlled experiment comparing this approach with a traditional language-based pedagogy has revealed that by the end of the course, studentspsila programming skills, even on language-specific tasks, is every bit as strong as students taught traditionally, and that their comfort level with modularity (writing functions) is increased. Additionally, we found that students appear to strongly prefer such an approach, citing mostly emotive benefits, and that these effects may be particularly strong among women.","2377-634X","978-1-4244-1969-2","10.1109/FIE.2008.4720362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4720362","Computational Thinking;Pedagogy;Pseudocode","Computer languages;Programming profession;Algorithm design and analysis;Natural languages;Problem-solving;Counting circuits;Functional programming;Writing;Pain;Education","","9","","10","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we carry out a bibliographic revision of previous works done on ML, and then describe an educational resource developed by the institution of the first two authors (INTEF) aimed to teach ML in schools with Scratch and Machine Learning for Kids.

The adoption of granular computing approach in the design of data classification systems improves their performance in dealing with data uncertainty and facilitates handling large volumes of data. In this paper, a new approach for the design of medical data classification systems is proposed. The proposed approach makes use of data granulation in training the classifier. Training data is granulated at different levels and data from each level is used for constructing the classification system. To evaluate performance of the proposed approach, a classification system based on neural network is implemented. Four medical datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed approach to other classifiers: neural network classifier, ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier. Results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance of neural network classifier and produces better accuracy and area under curve than other classifiers for most of the datasets used.","","978-1-4799-6926-5","10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300328","Artificial neural network;granular computing;data clustering;data classification","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Training data;Artificial neural networks;Training;Biological neural networks","","4","","19","IEEE","19 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
