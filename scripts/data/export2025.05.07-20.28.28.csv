In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.","","978-1-6654-5294-6","10.1109/ICCA56443.2022.10039663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039663","interdisciplinary learning;low-code development platform;dual coding theory;computational thinking;imagination;cloud computing","Cloud computing;Power measurement;Pain;Education;Computer architecture;Market research;Encoding","","","","17","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.","","978-1-7281-1666-2","10.1109/EDUNINE.2019.8875768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8875768","C++;computational thinking;scratch;programming;teaching","Education;Programming profession;Mathematics;Engineering profession;Computer languages","","","","7","IEEE","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The sense-think-act paradigm revisited","M. Siegel","Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","1st International Workshop on Robotic Sensing, 2003. ROSE' 03.","4 Aug 2003","2003","","","5 pp.","","Approximately 25 years have passed since the ""sense-act-think"" paradigm was advanced as the operational definition of a robot, and as a broad roadmap for robotics research. With the appearance of mobile robots that do real work in the real world, ""communicate"" has de facto been added to the list of functionalities that are essential features of robots. In keeping with the theme of the ROSE-2003 Workshop, this paper attempts to articulate and justify a set of intellectual and engineering challenges for 21 st century sensing and perception for robotics. It especially argues for examining the current and re-examining future roles for teleoperation, both as a practical route around the improbability that machine intelligence will equal human intelligence in the foreseeable future, and because it is apparent that sensor improvement is driven in large part by incremental advances in sensor-display design-and-test loops that are in turn driven by human factors governing perception.","","0-7803-8109-2","10.1109/ROSE.2003.1218700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1218700","","Robot sensing systems;Humans;Cognitive robotics;Mobile robots;Auditory displays;Machine intelligence;Intelligent robots;Service robots;Intelligent sensors;Mobile communication","","30","","12","IEEE","4 Aug 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing load balancing-oriented job scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical Grid model structure, following statistical thinking, this paper proposed a new task scheduling and resource allocation algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing within Grid systems. This algorithm consists of three main modules, they are load tracking module, job distributing module and load monitoring module. On the basis of having explained the functions of the different functional parts and the relationships between them, the corresponding pseudo-code algorithm are given. The results of simulative experiments show that the algorithm is effective.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4708988","Grid computing;resource allocation;task scheduling;load balancing;statistics","Load management;Scheduling algorithm;Statistics;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Grid computing;Internet;Local area networks;Computer science;Power systems","","7","","7","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.","","978-1-4244-5967-4","10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5705740","Learning Models;Problem-Solving;Recent Engineering","Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Cognition;Biological system modeling;Taxonomy;Solid modeling","","4","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A goal of the Visible Celltrade project is to integrate spatial as well as temporal models within a common data, computational and visualisation environment to support hypothesis-generation and hypothesis-testing by biologists and modellers. A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services.

This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004). Digital systems designers have almost always focused on the concept of exact computational capability. Error-tolerant VLSI chips are a step in this direction using today's technologies, addressing current computational needs, and accepting present realities of scale and yield.","2159-3477","0-7695-2365-X","10.1109/ISVLSI.2005.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1430102","","Testing;Manufacturing;Very large scale integration;Digital systems;Clocks;Wires;Roads;Engines;Automobile manufacture;Tires","","11","2","3","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, how to evaluate deep neural networks with explanations is still an urgent task. In this paper, we first propose a multi-semantic image recognition model, which enables human beings to understand the decision-making process of the neural network. Then, we presents a new evaluation index, which can quantitatively assess the model interpretability. We also comprehensively summarize the semantic information that affects the image classification results in the judgment process of neural networks.

There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044134","computational thinking;CS4HS;teacher perceptions","Conferences;Educational institutions;Computers;Mathematics;Programming","","12","","24","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
