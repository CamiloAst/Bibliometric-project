This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.","","979-8-3503-6016-5","10.1109/ICACITE60783.2024.10617194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10617194","AI-Powered Literary Criticism;Artificial Intelligence;Textual Analysis;Thematic Analysis;Stylometric Analysis;Algorithmic Bias;Ethical Considerations;Interdisciplinary Collaboration","Ethics;Sentiment analysis;Scholarships;Heuristic algorithms;Collaboration;Machine learning;Resonance","","","","50","IEEE","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing automated metrics like FID are unable to fully capture generation performance across both objective fidelity and subjective aesthetic attributes important to human perception. This paper conducts an extensive review of the literature on GAN evaluation methodology. Key limitations of current approaches are analyzed through a discussion of popular metrics and their inability to predict human judgment comprehensively. To address this, a novel hybrid evaluation model is proposed that combines automated scores with human ratings to provide a more balanced assessment. A pilot study demonstrates the hybrid metric can predict human response more accurately.","","979-8-3503-8749-0","10.1109/ICTACS62700.2024.10840839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10840839","Generative adversarial networks;GANs;Evaluation metrics;Model assessment;Human evaluation;Subjective attributes;Automatic scores;Hybrid evaluation;Computational creativity;Interactive frameworks;Generative capacity;Artistic exploration;Image synthesis;Deep learning","Measurement;Training;Reviews;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Generative adversarial networks;Real-time systems;Informatics;Creativity;Predictive maintenance","","","","15","IEEE","21 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the help of technology, pupils started to think and act much smarter. A biometric system consists of a device, a sensor, methods, techniques, etc. To find a match to a person, the system uses his physical features such as iris, palm, fingerprint, face, etc. Computational intelligence (CI) methods are commonly used to create biometric identity and overcome non‐idealities that are frequent in datasets. Common types include sample augmentation, feature extraction, categorization, indexing, fusion, normalization, and anti‐spoofing. Computational intelligence plays a vital role in conducting sophisticated nonlinear calculations by developing models from training data in this environment. These methods employ both supervised and unsupervised training procedures. This work presents a review of computational intelligence‐based biometric recognition methods.</p>","","9781394214242","10.1002/9781394214259.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10955532.pdf&bkn=10955392&pdfType=chapter","","Biometrics;Computational intelligence;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Kernel;Biological neural networks;Support vector machines;Iris recognition;Fuzzy logic;Artificial neural networks","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"

The problem is the existence of some insuperable barriers for our mind, another words barriers for principles of thinking. They are our clue and main reason for research. Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture. We start to express our thoughts in a language of mathematics, developing an apparatus for our Spatial Theory of Mind, suitable to represent processes and infrastructure of thinking. We use abstract algebra and stay invariant in relation to the nature of objects.","","978-1-4577-1958-5","10.1109/EWDTS.2011.6116427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6116427","","Context;Cognition;Complexity theory;Physics;Vocabulary;Face;Shape","","2","","12","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.","","978-1-4244-8343-3","10.1109/ICRESH.2010.5779541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779541","Simulation approach;time dependent availability analysis;Markov approach;complex systems;system dynamics;Markov System Dynamics","Availability;Analytical models;Markov processes;Computational modeling;Numerical models","","2","","14","IEEE","27 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This algorithm is a parallel/distributed version of the online algorithm VLP-PO that we proposed in prior work. The situation under consideration in this paper is that of a system whose structure can be expressed as the shuffle of three state machines G/sub 1/, G/sub 12/, and G/sub 2/ (with disjoint event sets), where G/sub 12/ is to be interpreted as a common interface between the two system components G/sub 1/ and G/sub 2/. The legal language, denoted K, is global, but it can also be expressed as the parallel composition of two languages, K/sup 1//spl par/K/sup 2/, where K/sup i//spl sube/L(G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/), i=1,2. There are two communicating agents that simultaneously run (online) identical versions of the algorithm but on different models and legal languages: agent i, i=1, 2, operates on subsystem G/sub i//spl par/G/sub 12/ and legal language K/sup i/. We show that this scheme achieves the same behavior as the sequential VLP-PO algorithm, but at a total execution complexity that is significantly lower; this algorithm generates maximal observable and controllable sublanguages of the given legal language K.<>","","0-7803-1968-0","10.1109/CDC.1994.411724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=411724","","Supervisory control;Law;Legal factors;Control systems;Discrete event systems;Computational complexity;Specification languages;State-space methods","","1","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
