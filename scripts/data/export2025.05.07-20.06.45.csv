Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is a practical concept to examine how CT education can be developed. This systematic literature review presents the discussion of K-8 teachers’ PCK in the implementation of CT- related activities in the classroom. Studies were extracted from Google Scholar’s database. Among these studies, 14 articles were deemed to be relevant for a more in-depth examination. Findings from this preliminary literature review suggest that teachers have clear purposes and goals for teaching CT and various instructional strategies for teaching CT. However, the existing studies lacked information about teachers’ knowledge and beliefs regarding the methods for assessing students’ CT. Practical implications and future directions to enhance K-8 teachers’ PCK on CT are discussed in this study.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-9117-4","10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148557","K-8;Computational thinking;Pedagogical content knowledge;Systematic literature review;Primary education","Knowledge engineering;Systematics;Databases;Bibliographies;Education;Internet;Lenses","","1","","27","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Collaborative Approach to Integrate Computational Thinking in an Integrated STEM Curriculum","D. Yang; S.

The initiative takes a collaborative approach that engages a range of stakeholders including higher institution's STEM educational researchers and disciplinary experts, a school district, three community centers and their satellite campus that serve Title I schools, and both in-service and pre-service teachers to develop and implement an integrated “STEM + CT” curriculum. The design and development of the integrated STEM+CT curriculum was guided by project-based learning (PBL) that engages students in sustained project-based activities and requires students to apply multiple STEM content knowledge and skills to solve a problem, in after-school programs where they enjoy large blocks of dedicated time to learn and practice CT and STEM. The implementation of the curriculum was led by in-service teachers in community centers' after-school programs who serve as facilitators and learners, and bring a depth of pedagogical knowledge, and who also benefit from such sustained interactions. This collaborative initiative brings relevant stakeholders together and helps build a researcher-practitioner partnership that aims to design, study, improve, and scale innovations in teaching and learning, which facilities the solving of a shared challenge of educational practice - how to integrate CT in K-12 STEM learning? - in this study. Lessons learned from the collaborative process are also discussed.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-8429-9","10.1109/ISEC54952.2022.10025038","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10025038","Computational thinking;Integrated STEM;Project-based learning;Researcher - practitioner partnership","Technological innovation;Satellites;Education;Collaboration;Stakeholders","","1","","16","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Games are recognized as a good strategy for presenting CT and for engaging children to the learning of its concepts. Hand gestures are a form of interaction widely used in video-games. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate how children feel and interact when using hand gestures in the context of learning tools. And this number decrease in studies about CT learning. In this paper, we explore the feedback of 29 children about their interaction by using hand gestures in a game to stimulate the CT which we called CT game. We also compare this type of interaction to touch. Additionally, we examine how both, hand gestures and touch, can impact on accomplishing of the goals of the game phases. Our findings revealed the children kept more engaged when using hand gestures, and consequently, this affected their concentration on the game purpose.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-3485-7","10.1109/ICALT.2019.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820841","computational thinking;games;hand gestures interaction;children","","","1","","21","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main instructional tool for this course is the BEAM robot, a robotics paradigm that proposes simple robots whose behavior can be controlled without software programming. The programming of this robot is implicit in its morphology, so its actions and goals are codified from its construction. A three-phase curriculum is designed to achieve the objective: propaedeutic, robot assembly, and CT. On the basis of these phases, the course is constructed modularly and implemented virtually, while students receive construction kits. Each phase aims to foster the many facets of CT, such as decomposition, abstraction, algorithm, debugging, iteration, and generalization. Students’ responses to pre-and post-course surveys, as well as evaluation activities and logs, are analyzed to determine the course’s impact on them. In addition to other STEM disciplines (electrical, electronic, mechanical, and WEEE), the course substantially improves the CT.","","978-1-7281-6715-2","10.1109/CONCAPAN48024.2022.9997660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9997660","STEM;BEAM;Computational Thinking;WEEE;Educational robotics","Morphology;Debugging;Organizations;Programming;Electronic waste;Software;Behavioral sciences","","","","20","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Computational Thinking (CT) and Rebel game Design: CT in health games","H.

The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”. Readers can benefit from a perspective with a different focus and increase awareness and understanding of CT with the hope of grooming future leaders with required CT problem-solving skills and abilities and applying “Rebel Design” for games.","","978-1-5090-5482-4","10.1109/SeGAH.2017.7939263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7939263","computational thinking (CT);rebel design;game;problem solving;connected;digital ecosystem;framework","Games;Problem-solving;Tools;Handheld computers","","","","24","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Collaboration scripts is a promising way to structure the collaborative process through three mechanisms: pp forming mechanism, role-task mechanism, the feedback mechanism. We conducted a pilot study to examine the effectiveness of collaboration in students' use of collaboration scripts and furthermore to evaluate the development of CT and math. Both quantitative and qualitative data about the students' CT skills, mathematical achievements and perceptions of collaboration scripts were collected. The results showed that the PP with collaboration scripts can improve the CT skills, mathematical achievements; facilitate higher collaborative relationship; give students good perceptions by teacher's feedback.","2166-0549","978-1-7281-9171-3","10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320720","computational thinking;pair programming;collaboration scripts","Task analysis;Programming profession;Technological innovation;Teamwork;Interviews;Terminology;Standards","","","","24","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Technologies are here to stay and it is therefore necessary, in some way, to change this paradigm with regard to the role that the teacher plays, from consumer to producer of technological resources. And, trying to contribute to this extremely complex scenery, this paper intends to show how a proposal launched in teacher education combined aspects of gamification and computational thinking, aiming to bring another look at teaching practice, or at least, increase the pedagogical repertoire of fellow Science and Mathematics teachers who participated in the meeting promoted by the Department of Education of the city of Taubaté, in the state of São Paulo. As a proposal, a suggestion of gamified activity in the style of a game known as “escape room” was presented, using the Google Forms tool. We note that insecurity with technological tools or lack of knowledge about some features of these same tools is still a factor that causes many concerns among teachers. We concluded that reflection on ourpractice is fundamental, and, in a way, we realize that we have managed to broaden our horizons about the use of certain technological tools.","","978-1-6654-2358-8","10.1109/LACLO54177.2021.00105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725170","Computational Thinking;Gamification;Teacher Training","Training;Urban areas;Organizations;Games;IEEE Fellows;Reflection;Mathematics","","","","0","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
