In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. Again, the results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA.","2473-4659","978-1-5386-8520-4","10.1109/ICCABS.2018.8542038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8542038","PLS-DA;PCA;Feature Selection;Dimensionality Reduction;Bioinformatics","Bioinformatics;Principal component analysis;Tools;Feature extraction;Data models;Machine learning;Signal to noise ratio","","5","","0","IEEE","22 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People are also becoming more interested in direct current (DC) MGs because DC delivery schemes have benefits like less damage and quick alignment of energy loading resources. With the rise of distributed output, a DCMG with many fonts is an important area to investigate. In this DCMG with many sources, the goal is to offer voltage help and strong value division. The control technique includes a thorough analysis of the ""state-of-the-art"" control procedures in DCMGs. This is important because it makes sure that MG's power and performance are always the same. In this section, the main and secondary control mechanisms in the DCMG hierarchy are explained. In particular, the main ways to control internal loop and droop control are looked at. The secondary regulation is a solution that is centralized, spread out, and independent.","","978-1-6654-7416-0","10.1109/CISCT55310.2022.10046557","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046557","DC Microgrids;droop regulation;power-sharing;prime control;and subordinate control","Power engineering;Systematics;Heuristic algorithms;Loading;Microgrids;Regulation;Systems thinking","","4","","20","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, algorithm design and coding is the fun part. This paper presents a survey of all such games up to February 2020 published in the Steam digital distribution platform, categorizing them by content covered according to a basic programming curriculum.

It refers to a set of capacities and skills that can be stimulated to facilitate the teaching-learning process in a wide range of fields, including Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Experts in information technology argue that the earlier children are exposed to programming through digital platforms appropriate for their age, the easier it will be for them to assimilate their concepts in the future. This effort should be continued throughout the educational stages of children and youth to increase students' interest in pursuing STEM studies and careers.This paper describes the Scratch4All project promoted by the consortium CASPAE (a Private Social Solidarity Institution) and Inova-Ria, with technical assistance from professors at the public higher education institution Coimbra Institute of Engineering. Scratch4All Project includes the activities Scratch on Road, Programming and Robotics Lab, and the Scratch4All Digital Platform. According to the impact assessment for the school year 2020-2021, the Scratch4All project promotes school success and true equality in access to new technologies for students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd cycles of elementary school, developing essential skills for their academic and professional future such as computational thinking, STEM competencies and social skills.

Existing automated metrics like FID are unable to fully capture generation performance across both objective fidelity and subjective aesthetic attributes important to human perception. This paper conducts an extensive review of literature on GAN evaluation methodology. Key limitations of current approaches are analyzed through a discussion of popular metrics and their inability to predict human judgment comprehensively. To address this, a novel hybrid evaluation model is proposed that combines automated scores with human ratings to provide a more balanced assessment. A pilot study demonstrates the hybrid metric can predict human response more accurately. However, additional validation is required. The review emphasizes the need for evaluation systems integrating richer human input to better optimize models according to user priorities. Interactive frameworks and techniques from computational creativity may help advance assessment towards comprehensively benchmarking generative capacity and artistic exploration.","","979-8-3315-3038-9","10.1109/CICTN64563.2025.10932502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10932502","generative adversarial networks;GANs;evaluation metrics;model assessment;human evaluation;subjective attributes;automatic scores;hybrid evaluation;computational creativity;interactive frameworks;generative capacity;artistic exploration;image synthesis;deep learning","Measurement;Training;Reviews;Image synthesis;Computational modeling;Instruments;Benchmark testing;Generative adversarial networks;Hybrid power systems;Creativity","","","","15","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
