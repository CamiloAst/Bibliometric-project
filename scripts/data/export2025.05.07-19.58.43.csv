Most students are unaware they are using these skills and that these skills are the foundation of learning computer science. Over a series of workshops, high school teachers and students, and university faculty discussed the need to incorporate CT skills throughout the high school curriculum to improve those skills in students and to impart a better understanding of computer science. The result was a guide created to assist high school teachers to make CT concepts explicit in their classes. A main component of the guide includes specific examples of how to incorporate CT skills in various content areas. The guide was created on a foundation of cultural relevance and cogenerative dialogues. Here we describe salient points about the creation of the guide and insights gained during these workshops.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893039","computational thinking;diversity;inclusivity;underrepresentation;k-12;preconceptions","Computer science;Conferences;Education;Cultural differences","","","","8","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there remains a significant gap in the availability of intelligent tools that effectively foster computational thinking in line with contemporary educational needs. To address this, the present study proposes a gamified intelligent tutoring system that supports learners' CT development through a process-oriented assessment methodology and targeted guidance. The assessment framework leverages machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models based on the frequency of six behavioral elements observed during gameplay, including a process-oriented failure risk assessment model for formative evaluation and a summative computational thinking level assessment model. The system identifies the critical process element contributing most to the prediction outcome to provide targeted guidance for learners at risk of failure or exhibiting low computational performance. Using a dataset of 754 real learner cases, five machine learning algorithms were compared, and multi-metric evaluation confirmed strong predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 80%. Logistic regression was selected as the final algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability, ensuring practical applicability. The tool will enable the scaling and personalization of computational thinking development.","","979-8-3315-4088-3","10.1109/ICEIT64364.2025.10975898","National Natural Science Foundation in China(grant numbers:62277018,62237001); Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences(grant numbers:22YJC880106); South China Normal University(grant numbers:ZDPY2208); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10975898","computational thinking;intelligent tutoring system;gamified Learning;process-oriented assessment;machine learning","Logistic regression;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Focusing;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Risk management;Problem-solving;Information technology","","","","29","IEEE","1 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model. Experiments with ACT-R also indicate the effectiveness of CAUT architecture.","2157-9563","978-1-4244-9953-3","10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022208","Cognitive architecture;Cognitive model;Human thinking","Speech;Humans;Computer architecture;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Cognition;Presses","","2","","26","IEEE","19 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there is a scarcity of information available regarding the challenges faced by students and the development of their conceptual knowledge in these learning environments, particularly in relation to the integrated curriculum. There is a need to help with course-level curriculum development to improve teaching and learning. Hence, this paper proposes an artificial intelligence-based student computational thinking analysis model (AI-SCTAM) to predict student engagement in learning and improve curriculum development. This research attempted to determine the association between student engagement measures using the machine learning (ML) method to determine the degrees of student involvement. The ML divides students into two groups: highly engaged and poorly engaged, according to the criteria used to measure their degree of involvement. The findings of the correlation study showed a positive association between engagement measures and performance. Analyzing the relationship between student engagement and performance will guide the development of course materials and activities. STEM education metrics based on engagement levels will be proposed to personalize students' learning experiences.","","979-8-3315-0574-5","10.1109/ICMLAS64557.2025.10968634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10968634","Artificial Intelligence (AI);Machine Learning (ML);Curriculum Development;Computational Thinking","Training;Analytical models;Pandemics;Computational modeling;Curriculum development;Machine learning;Social factors;Artificial intelligence;Public healthcare;Programming profession","","","","21","IEEE","25 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional assessment methods like questionnaires can produce disengaged responses or require additional work to understand the questions and have limitations in the assessment of dynamic self-efficacy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.","","979-8-3503-6260-2","10.1109/TIMES-iCON61890.2024.10630739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10630739","Computational Thinking;Educational game;Game features;Self-efficacy","Games;Strategic planning;Innovation management;Animation;Particle measurements;Real-time systems;Problem-solving","","","","25","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
