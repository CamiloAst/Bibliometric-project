"A novel approach to evolutionary computing: A complexity study with systems thinking","Binghui Helen Wu","Fs consulting, Wichita, Kansas, USA",2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST),"27 Feb 2014","2013","","","614","619","This paper is a sequel to “A novel approach to evolutionary computing: an introduction” in which I describe how the modern software can be viewed as a complex adaptive system and how software evolution can be placed or mapped in parallel to the Darwinian Evolution Theory of biology. Calling it a novel approach to evolutionary computing because, instead of working toward genetic computational approaches to biology, it studies complex adaptive systems in software as if software is the same among biological populations that abide by evolutionary theories of biology. This paper explores the relationship between complexity study as a scientific endeavor and systems thinking as a problem solving skill while approaching to generic software solutions, known as Computational Intelligence, to any problem of our interests at hand. The paper argues that skills in systems thinking are critical and applying them may add values to software development activities, especially to large-scale complex software aiming for the high quality and rapid productivity. Examples will be provided to support arguments in the paper.","2164-4357","978-1-4673-2764-0","10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747623","","Computers;Complexity theory;Games;Program processors;Biology;Problem-solving","","","","23","IEEE","27 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional machine learning technologies deal with object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, and behavior acquisition. This paper presents a supervised machine knowledge learning methodology for concept elicitation from sample dictionaries in natural languages. Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base. The results of machine-generated concepts demonstrate that the AMCE algorithm can over perform human knowledge expressions in dictionaries in terms of relevance, accuracy, quantitativeness, and cohesiveness.","","978-1-5090-3846-6","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862015","Machine learning;cognitive robots;concept elicitation;experiment;formal concepts;knowledge extraction;knowledge representation;concept algebra;cognitive knowledge base;algorithms","Algebra;Handheld computers;Writing;Instruments;Animals;Semantics","","12","","52","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The data transmitted and generated using them are growing exponentially. The traffic on these networks requires surveillance. Effective network traffic surveillance, packet analysis and rules to define the traffic flow are in place using various intrusion detection and prevention systems. However, the security issues and concerns are dictating the need to evolve with the novel and `human-like' methods to mitigate them. Normal methods and techniques may prove too tedious, and sometimes will not even render fruitful results. In that case, the techniques that can think, act and mimic human beings assure the possibilities of resolving the concerns where the domain of artificial intelligence plays a critical role. Also, there is a crucial need to design real-time models that can analyze & handle bigger, more complex data; and deliver faster as well as accurate results. Machine learning is a subfield which possesses all of the attributes. Intrusion preventions IDPS's integrate methods that help to prevent intrusive and non-intrusive data packets [2]. According to survey, most of the intrusion prevention methods rely heavily on humans to analyze data and classify into intrusive and non-intrusive networks. When the data to compute is very large, computing methods such as Computational intelligence and its constituent are essential to use as humans have their own shortcomings. Computational intelligence and machine learning are widely used to detect the intrusions, which in turn help in preventing the same. Pattern recognition uses algorithms to handle very large data sets.

"6.8: Presentation session: Neuroanatomy, neuroregeneration, and modeling: “GPGPU implementation of a synaptically optimized, anatomically accurate spiking network simulator”","R. Scorcioni","Neurosciences Institute, USA",2010 Biomedical Sciences and Engineering Conference,"15 Jul 2010","2010","","","1","2","Simulation of biological spiking networks is becoming more relevant in understanding neuronal processes. An increasing proportion of these simulations focuses on large scale modeling efforts. Unfortunately the size of large networks is often limited by both computational power and memory. Computational power constrains both the maximum number of differential equations and the maximum number of spikes that can be processed per unit time. Memory size limits the maximum number of neurons and synapses that can be simulated. To solve for the computational bottleneck, a neuronal simulator is implemented on a CUDA-based General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU). CUDA provides a C-like environment to harness the computational power of specialized video cards from NVIDIA (these cards provide a computational peak power on single precision floats of 1TFLOPS, at least an order of magnitude higher than the fastest CPU). To solve for the memory bottleneck, a just-in-time synapse storing algorithm is implemented requiring only 4 bytes per synapse. Only the synaptic weight is stored, while both post-synaptic contact and delay are recomputed at run-time. This allows a resource shift from memory to computation which fits with the peculiar GPGPU architecture, where an abundance of compute nodes access the memory via a bandwidth-limited bus. Neurons are represented by a single compartment whose activity is modeled by the Izhikevich formalism. Excitatory synapses are plastic and follow both a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and a short term potentiation/depression rule. We are able to simulate networks with up to a million neurons and up to 100 million synapses on a single GPGPU card. Networks of this size cannot be simulated on desktop computers. For smaller networks the speedup obtained is at least of an order of magnitude compared to traditional CPU platform. As an example of possible use of the present work we present preliminary results on the simulation of early stage of the visual pathway. In the retina, Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC) project to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). LGN projects to the cortical area V1. V1 projects back to LGN. The network is represented by 100,000 neurons, 10 million synapses, and 32 different morphological classes with >350 topological projections. Input to the network is provided by current injection in the RGC layer. The RGC layer models midget and parasol ganglion cells (representing 80% of the RGC in primates). Each ganglion type is then subdivided into on- and off-center cells for a total of 4 different types of RGC. Training is performed via natural stimuli while testing is done with vertical and horizontal bars. The network average spiking frequency is within biological limits. Testing performed with both vertical and horizontal bars shows each pattern propagating along the network's anatomical projections. At each stage the pattern is progressively elaborated and modified. In conclusion we present a novel simulator that is fast, synaptically optimized and anatomically accurate. At an additional cost to an available desktop PC of few hundred dollars we think the GPGPU is an ideal platform to simulate large spiking networks.","","978-1-4244-6714-3","10.1109/BSEC.2010.5510833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510833","","Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Neurons;Biology computing;Computer networks;Central Processing Unit;Retina;Performance evaluation;Testing;Bars","","","","","IEEE","15 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recognizing this imperative, engineering curricula are increasingly incorporating a competency-based approach that reflects the complexities of the real world, for lifelong learning, using enabling and disruptive technologies such as humanoid robotics. We present a case study from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus, where NAO robots are used in social projects with immediate impact in the fields of health and education, addressing sustainable development objectives. This research shows projects that have had a significant social impact in different communities in Mexico, in the areas of education and health with innovative solutions that motivate and engage the attention of the audience. A group of students from different engineering careers design, develop and implement application scenarios for the accompaniment and social appropriation of challenges such as: the incorporation of girls in STEM areas, support for groups with intellectual disabilities, dissemination and knowledge of sign language and dissemination of the cultural heritage of Xochimilco as a cultural heritage of humanity. Preliminary results indicate that this pedagogical approach not only inculcates students with essential skills such as problem solving, critical thinking and teamwork, but also makes them more aware of the social implications of their engineering studies. Evidence and results of the involvement of undergraduate students in social scenarios are shown, showing that, by integrating these elements, engineering programs aspire to train professionals capable of harnessing their technical knowledge for the general good of society as well as the perception of the participants and audiences reached.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578766","Complex thinking;competency-based education;educational innovation;higher education;data visualization;computational thinking","Knowledge engineering;Visualization;Sign language;Educational robots;Urban areas;Teamwork;Cultural differences","","","","33","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But, how students' strategy use, self-regulation, knowledge building, and engagement impact different learning outcomes is not well understood. Our goal in this study was to investigate how motivation, strategic self-regulation, and creative competency were associated with course achievement and long-term learning of computational thinking knowledge and skills in introductory computer science courses. Student grades and long-term retention were positively associated with self-regulated strategy use and knowledge building, and negatively associated with lack of regulation. Grades were associated with higher study effort and knowledge retention was associated with higher study time. For motivation, higher learning- and task-approach goal orientations, endogenous instrumentality, and positive affect and lower learning-, task-, and performance-avoid goal orientations, exogenous instrumentality and negative affect were associated with higher grades and knowledge retention and also with strategic self-regulation and engagement. Implicit intelligence beliefs were associated with strategic self-regulation, but not grades or knowledge retention. Creative competency was associated with knowledge retention, but not grades, and with higher strategic self-regulation.

There is also a challenge in understanding the rising trend of this tendency. It is essential to explore the reasons driving people of all ages to consider suicide and find ways to encourage them to choose life instead. In the modern era, social media acts as a crucial platform where people share their thoughts, activities, and emotional states. This has led to the consideration of whether analyzing social media posts could help discern whether individuals are experiencing joy or sadness, particularly to detect levels of sadness that could indicate suicidal thoughts. This paper employs artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze the social media posts of individuals to gauge their mental state, specifically targeting signs that might indicate a risk of suicide. The study has found a high frequency of suicidal thoughts among those who appear depressed on social media. This research investigated the possibility to identify the likelihood of someone contemplating suicidal through their online behavior. This research demonstrates the potential of utilizing social media analysis to identify and support individuals at risk of suicide, providing new insights into recognizing and assessing suicidal thoughts and representing a significant advancement in suicide prevention efforts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3454292","Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664621","Depression;exploratory analysis;feature extraction;LDA;NLP;suicide;unsupervised model","Social networking (online);Depression;Mental health;Machine learning;Analytical models;Accuracy;Mirrors;Unsupervised learning","","","","58","CCBYNCND","4 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
