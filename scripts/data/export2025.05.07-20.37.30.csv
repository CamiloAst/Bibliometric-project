Nevertheless, we think that cognitive systems will allow to correct several problems of behavior like credibility, or wrong behavior that occur in some areas such as: virtual reality, artificial life, autonomous agents, humanoid robots, human-computer interaction. In this paper we propose a biological inspired computational model for motor planning applied to virtual creatures. We present the results of a case study taken from Neurosciences to validate our model. Also, the flow of information in our model emulating the flow of information of the human brain is presented.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2015.7040622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7040622","autonomous agents;Cognitive systems;motor planning;virtual reality","Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Monitoring;Solid modeling;Visualization;Planning;Robots","","2","","","IEEE","12 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way to a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects. Using BCI to control a drone will open the way toward smooth and high-response flight. Deep learning is a new-age skill that has made many breakthroughs and influenced modern technologies. It has made it possible to predict and identify even the most complex and abstract patterns that even we humans would be very challenged to catch ourselves. In this paper, a method of controlling a drone using BCI has been presented using an 8-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Deep learning has been employed to process and classify human brain waves. After testing the resulting deep learning algorithm, the overall classification accuracy was 90% to distinguish between four different movements of the drone.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-2028-2","10.1109/CSCI58124.2022.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216687","Deep Learning;DL;EEG;Brain-Computer Interface;BCI;Brain-Machine Interface;ECOG;SSVEP;RNN;BMI;LSTM","Deep learning;Headphones;Scientific computing;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Classification algorithms;Synchronization","","5","","18","IEEE","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue in this short paper that lessons can be learned from organizational science results explaining variance on three different abstraction levels of organizations. We suggest agility needs to be explained from organizational (macro), the team (meso), and individual (micro) levels to provide useful and actionable guidelines to practitioners. We are currently designing such studies and hope that they will eventually result in validated measurements that can be used to prevent companies from investing in the wrong areas when trying to move towards more agility.","","978-1-5386-2652-8","10.1109/CSCI.2017.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560939","agile;software engineering;software development;project management","","","2","","19","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Controlling machines using the concept of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a practical method that opens the way toward a fully synchronized method between human thoughts and controlled objects.

This paper presents a method for brain waves recognition using deep learning based on shapes and colors for use in merging concepts of the IoT and BCI, which we defined as the “Internet of Brain Controlled Things (IoBCT).” We used a low-cost 8-channel Electroencephalography (EEG) headset, and the results showed an acceptable accuracy of 93% in the brain waves pattern recognition, which opens the way for designing a reliable IoBCT.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-2028-2","10.1109/CSCI58124.2022.00217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10216405","Deep Learning;DL;EEG;IoT;Brain-Computer Interface;BCI;Brain-Machine Interface;BMI;IoBCT;LSTM","Deep learning;Shape;Scientific computing;Merging;Reliability engineering;Electroencephalography;Brain-computer interfaces","","2","","23","IEEE","4 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many attempts have been made to help students learn these concepts through visualizations and various teaching techniques; however, these methods are mostly limited to the classroom and do not allow the student time to fully explore the concepts by themselves. By enabling students to interact with the material at their own pace, through an easily accessible and dynamic learning environment, students should be better able to retain and understand the concepts of Computer Science. Binary Search Tree (BST) is an abstract concept which can easily be converted into an interactive format suitable for student self-learning. To see whether an interactive format enhances students learning, a web-based prototype was created. The game consists of forming links between orbs, selecting orbs, copying orbs and removing orbs. This allows for all operations of Binary Search Trees to be explored while presenting the concept in a simple manner. As operations are preformed, and links are made, pseudocode is highlighted in the information menu as a way to reinforce learning and provide context to the operations. In order to measure the effectiveness of the prototype, a pre-survey and a post survey are integrated into the web application.","","978-1-7281-1360-9","10.1109/CSCI46756.2018.00129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8947872","Gamification, Learning, Education","Games;Computer science;Binary search trees;Education;Media;Tools","","1","","5","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The app works through a program that clusters images based on their design and style. Throughout this process, the user will see the effectiveness of his/her painting through their match with well-known paintings. The program's present version can generate accurate matches for several works done by young children.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457851","Deep Learning;Art Style;Artist Recognition;Art Match;Education;Tensorflow","Deep learning;Rabbits;Art;Scientific computing;Mobile applications;Rivers;Creativity","","1","","9","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
