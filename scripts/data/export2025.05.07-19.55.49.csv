Teaching computational thinking has received particular attention, and more research is needed on using educational games to directly teach computational thinking skills. We propose to investigate this using Dragon Architect, an educational block-based programming game we are developing. Specifically, we wish to study ways of directly teaching computational thinking strategies such as divide and conquer in an educational game, as well as ways to evaluate our approaches.","","978-1-4673-8367-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7369019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369019","block-based programming;game-based learning;computational thinking;CS education","Games;Programming profession;Programming environments;Computer science education;Problem-solving","","7","","15","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028503","thermodynamics;computational thinking","Mathematical model;Thermodynamics;Interviews;Problem-solving;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Testing","","2","","11","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational Thinking (CT) could be a dependable approach. This paper presents ways of ensuring synergy among engineering educators through computational thinking. A questionnaire survey that sought information from the respondents on the ways computational thinking: promotes thinking abilities, reduces personal clashes, and improves decision-making process among the engineering educators was administered to 400 respondents. 348 survey answers were returned, found reliable and used in the data analysis. The analysis revealed that computational thinking plays vital roles in the repositioning of engineering education for solving of novel problems, assurance of mutual respect among educators, and intensive research for renown engineering education with relative contribution index above 0.8.
