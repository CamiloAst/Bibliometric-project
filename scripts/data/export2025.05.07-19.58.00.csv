"Discipline-Specific Critical Thinking Curriculum with A Problem Solving Life Cycle Framework","C. S. Lee; C. -C.

It emphasizes self-reflection and critical examination. There are few proven methods to teach critical thinking effectively, and assessment of students' thinking skills often fell short. Most universities do not teach critical thinking in a cohesive and systematic fashion after the students enter a specific discipline, such as management or engineering. This paper proposes to design a discipline specific critical thinking curriculum by adopting a Problem Solving Life Cycle framework. Critical thinking skills are reinforced in every phase throughout the Life Cycle with documented deliverables and assessment criteria.","","978-1-7281-1360-9","10.1109/CSCI46756.2018.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8947875","critical thinking;curriculum design;assessment;problem solving life cycle","Problem-solving;Business;Taxonomy;Cognition;Information systems;Training","","","","15","IEEE","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However it is important to go deeper and understand how computational thinking activities fosters the cognitive development of the young, especially if we want them to have “a significant advantage in problem solving”, becoming innovative thinkers [1]. To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab). Using a Case Study we want to show that computational thinking and digital fabrication projects demand the use of formal thinking and, since that, the importance of designing learning activities for makerspaces taking in mind the possibilities of cognitive development.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190654","formal thinking;computational thinking;making;Jean Piaget","Fabrication;Tools;Games;Computational modeling;Complexity theory;Creativity;Floors","","4","","17","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking, as a critical problem-solving skill in the era of artificial intelligence, has also become a basic literacy for students to face the future. However, the traditional “duck and filler” teaching mode is ineffective in developing computational thinking skills, while the gamified learning approach allows learners to interact with games in an immersive way. Therefore, this study combines games and programming teaching, builds a teaching model of gamified text programming, and develops a series of programming courses. It can develop not only computational thinking skills and improve students' programming ability but also effectively avoid the limitations of traditional programming teaching.","","979-8-3503-2572-0","10.1109/CSTE59648.2023.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261572","computational thinking;gamified teaching;text programming;teaching model","Codes;Computational modeling;Education;Games;Digital intelligence;Problem-solving;Artificial intelligence","","1","","22","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New technologies have positioned more as a communication tool than as a means for building innovative products. On the other hand, it has missed the application of own abilities in the area, such as the development of logical reasoning, algorithmic thinking and problem solving, both the school curriculum as well as in instances of informal learning of students. In literature and on the web, there are tools that are accessible by both self-study students to be used as a complement to other activities. However, these tools seek the development of computational thinking itself, and not within a broader framework, which allows to present the computer science as an area of professional development, for example, inserted in a context where should solve problems requiring support programming and algorithms. Problock is proposed as a tool to (1) develop computational thinking, in a context of learning based on addiction problems, (2) disseminate and motivate students for future professional development in higher education in computer science and disciplines related.

The incorporation at earlier stages of CT and related concepts to students' education has gained significance and is paramount evidenced by the changes in policy, curriculum and practice. This work deals with the computational education considerations for the Freshman Engineering Course learners, a step further than teaching with programming and employing CT elements for enhancing student's problem-solving abilities and logical thoughts which benefit to a great extent throughout the student's learning expedition.
