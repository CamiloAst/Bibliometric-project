It can evaluate the feasibility of images by constructing the computational model of human aesthetic thinking. In this paper, a color harmony evaluation method based on color complexity was implemented. Given the classical color harmony model which is suitable for the simple color combination but not suitable for the complex image, and the local feature redundancy caused by grid sampling, an adaptive sampling based on CCM(color complexity measure) was implemented. Then, K-means was adopted to extract local color harmony features. Finally, a model was constructed between local color harmony features and the overall color harmony by SVM. The results show that the method implemented in this paper can represent the color harmony of complex images accurately and effectively.","","978-1-7281-8138-7","10.1109/ICCST50977.2020.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262740","color harmony;CCM (color complexity measure);adaptive partitioning;Moon-Spencer color harmony theory","Image color analysis;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Visual perception;Wheels;Computational modeling;Complexity theory","","1","","15","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost.","2475-7896","978-1-6654-4029-5","10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624559","Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar;converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF);EKF;UKF;CKF;transition density based particle filter (TD-PF);posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB)","Atmospheric measurements;Radar;Filtering algorithms;Radar tracking;Particle measurements;Particle filters;Computational efficiency","","7","","37","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the intersection of technology, human creativity and emotional expression by proposing a novel approach to detecting creative states through the analysis of emotional cues derived from speech. To validate the findings, a linguistic prompt creativity test was conducted, incorporating both human evaluations and AI-driven assistance as the co-collaborative approach, using the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) as the evaluation criteria. The study analysed 50 creative speech samples from 25 participants, each exposed to happy and sad video stimuli to evoke distinct emotional responses. The results reveal a correlation between emotional states and creativity. In 80% of the participants, higher creativity levels were observed when they experienced positive emotions and happiness, highlighting the significant influence of emotional context on creative expression and creative states and also aligning with the psychological research on exploring the effects of emotions on creativity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3564499","Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologia(grant numbers:UIDB/00066/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10977009","Computational Creativity;Affective Computing;Emotion Detection;Sentiment Analysis;Linguistic Computation;LLM;NLTK;Emroberta","Creativity;Linguistics;Emotion recognition;Artificial intelligence;Technological innovation;Wheels;Shape;Problem-solving;Cultural differences;Cognitive processes","","","","","CCBY","25 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the model, ideas emerge as conceptual combinations from the interaction of complex dynamics at several semantic levels: features, concepts, categories, and previously generated ideas. This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system. We also briefly describe a computational model for ideation in groups using a multi-agent formalism. The initial focus of this model is on studying the potential benefits of cognitive diversity in agent groups, e.g., the presence of convergent and divergent thinkers, or agents with different semantic organizations.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-3548-7","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178932","","Brain modeling;Cognition;Biological neural networks;Context modeling;Basal ganglia;Computational modeling;Resonance;Humans;Computer science;Cultural differences","","10","","56","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, any model of teaching/learning should include a unique component of human interaction (i.e., interaction between instructors and students) to make such models appropriate for implementation. The nature of online courses is such that there is no physical interaction between the instructors and students. Thus, the development and implementation of these models, with constructive collaboration between students and instructors in mind, is more challenging for the instructors. In this paper, we examine issues related to the partnership between students and instructors in online courses and propose steps that can be taken to make this collaboration not only feasible but also effective in persuading students to participate in the partnership throughout the semester actively.","","978-1-5386-2652-8","10.1109/CSCI.2017.209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560969","Student-Instructor Collaboration;Online Courses;Critical Thinking","","","","","4","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Data-structure validator: An application of the HY-DE model","M. Csernoch; E.

Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.","","978-1-5386-1264-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268242","information literacy;computational thinking;hyper and deep attention;data structure;webpage conversion","Tools;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Data structures;Media;Software","","6","","18","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A choreographer has to finalize appropriate dance steps from amongst millions of possibilities. Though it is not impossible, the choreographer being human cannot explore, analyze and remember all these variations among steps due to large scale of available options. Hence, we propose to simplify the problem of exploring and selecting dance steps from amongst the huge set of all possible variations for an Indian Classical Dance, BharataNatyam (BN). Based on a computational model developed by Jadhav et al. [13], we propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) driven automatic system that would provide a list of unexplored novel dance steps to choreographers. We have incorporated certain measures to ensure that the proposed dance steps should be feasible and appropriate. In this paper, we discuss an automated approach to obtain unexplored dance steps using a proposed fitness function for a single beat/count.
