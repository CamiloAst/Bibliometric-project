Description of parts and units of products have been completed by related objects such as results of analyses, interacting humans, equipment control programs, rules, and so on. Humans define these objects by using of contextual connections. Considering current product modeling, the next step of development is application of achievements from the area of intelligent computing at the definition of engineering objects in product models. This paper introduces a method for the application of knowledge based decision making in order to replace the conventional direct definition of engineering objects in model based product development. The authors developed a new modeling method on the basis of their earlier proposed concept of information content. In this paper, they introduce this modeling method and detail its application in the form of an extension to the classical model space that is suitable for control of engineering object definition through a contextual chain starting from influencing humans.","","978-1-4244-7433-2","10.1109/ICCCYB.2010.5491241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491241","","Humans;Context modeling;Knowledge engineering;Intelligent structures;Systems engineering and theory;Product development;Intelligent systems;Informatics;Decision making;Problem-solving","","","","12","IEEE","21 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A definite part of the physical world, typically a product and its operating environment is described in a computer system for a virtual space in order to data management during development, analysis, production, marketing, support, and recycling. One of the recent researches by the authors of this paper focuses to communication between human and engineering virtual space in order to enhance human control. In this paper, a new method is characterized that was proposed by the authors as a contribution to information intensive engineering environments. Main purpose of the proposed method is to realize a consistent model, where decisions are done strictly according to the human communicated control information, while this information is stored for the related engineering objects in the product model and control actions are coordinated.","","978-1-4244-9280-0","10.1109/CINTI.2010.5672251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672251","","Aerospace electronics;Humans;Knowledge representation;Analytical models;Finite element methods;Load modeling","","","","12","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program. The relative performances of the two algorithms are compared in the context of their applicability. Performance analysis undertaken reveals that the proposed algorithms outperform their competitors with respect to three important metrics. The proposed algorithms have successfully been employed in developing chapter-end exercises for trigonometric identity proving problems.","2168-2232","","10.1109/TSMC.2025.3550723","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10939005","Automatic generation of trigonometric identities;best-first search (BFS) in an OR-tree;computational creativity (CC);diversity and penalty estimate","Geometry;Costs;Creativity;Cost function;Search problems;Training;Measurement;Art;Neural networks;Cognition","","","","","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Techniques such as definition, elenchus, dialectic, maieutics, generalization, and counterfactual reasoning are discussed for their application in engineering prompt templates and their connections to inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning. Through examples, the effectiveness of these dialogue and reasoning methods is demonstrated. An interesting observation is made that when the task's goal and user intent are conveyed to GPT-3 via ChatGPT before the start of a dialogue, the large language model seems to connect to the external context expressed in the intent and perform more effectively.","","979-8-3503-3286-5","10.1109/CCWC57344.2023.10099179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099179","large language model;natural language processing;prompting;the Socratic method","Systematics;Computational modeling;Conferences;Writing;Chatbots;Cognition;Task analysis","","17","","45","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
