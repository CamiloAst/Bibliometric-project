Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274063","modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking","Grammar;Unified modeling language;Education;Computational modeling;Informatics;Computer science;Tools","","2","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Power systems will need to be monitored continuously to maintain stability under normal and abnormal operating conditions and when facing disturbances. A combination of system state prediction, dynamic power flow, system optimization, and solution stability checking will allow for a more reliable, affordable, efficient and clean power grid. The optimization and control systems on a smart grid will require a computational systems thinking capability to handle the uncertainties and variability that exist in a smart grid environment. The concept of sense-making based on computational intelligence methods, including neural networks, fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence, as well as online measurements from a smart grid to provide `situational' awareness in the context of stability, is introduced in this paper.","1944-9925","978-1-4577-1002-5","10.1109/PES.2011.6039876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6039876","computational intelligence;intelligent agents;sense-making;situational awareness;smart grid;stability;transient stability assessment;wide area monitoring and control","Power system stability;Smart grids;Stability criteria;Awards activities;Computational intelligence;Real time systems","","11","","12","IEEE","10 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458209","BBC micro:bit;female secondary school students;ICT curriculum;MST-tree model;Scratch","Training;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Government;Information and communication technology;Computational intelligence","","5","","39","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Put simply, they consist of tendencies to disbelieve what one would not like to be true, and believe what one would like to be true. We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2013.2247831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496211","","Affective computing;Human factors;Emotion recognition;Human computer interaction;Behavioral science","","1","","21","IEEE","11 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.","","978-1-7281-7031-2","10.1109/AI4G50087.2020.9311041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311041","poverty mapping;informal settlements;remote sensing;machine learning","Time series analysis;Satellites;Indexes;Earth;Vegetation mapping;Computational modeling;Sociology","","3","","20","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our system is motivated by the desire to encourage curiosity, facilitate creative ideation, and overcome design fixation. We start with a model for “conceptual shift”: when a sketch recognized as belonging to one category is visually similar to a sketch from a semantically distinct category. Identifying a potential conceptual shift enables visual analogy and/or conceptual blending. The intent is that these conceptually shifted or blended sketches could be presented to designers to encourage analogical reasoning and creative outcomes. We define and demonstrate our model for the conceptual shift task and alternative approaches for enabling conceptual blends.
