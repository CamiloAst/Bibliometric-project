Information society is everywhere in contemporary life, and algorithmic thinking represents a significant competency for individuals, irrespective of their educational background and social condition. Developing and applying programming competencies represents a high-value know-how ability. Block-based coding and design tools like Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino allow people to successfully build programming competencies in online environments regardless of age and social status. This article presents empirical evidence of the positive impact of the block-based programming language Scratch and the design tool TikerCAD Arduino in practical workshops to develop computational thinking with school children, school teachers, and university students. The results permit finding patterns, and almost transversal teaching approaches to build an elementary computational thinking competency applying Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino, with a block-based approach in both tools and textual programming in the second one. The motivation and wishes of learning in all participants were hegemonic. Those results demonstrate the positive impact of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino on developing computational thinking competencies without restrictions. This work shows the application of Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino in non-WEIRD contexts and, during the pandemic time, demonstrates the relevance of online education. The results show that developing programming competencies with Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino motivated students’ autonomy and motivation for learning regardless of their education level and status. Those results encourage us to continue using Scratch and TinkerCAD Arduino to develop programming competencies without considering age and education level.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3449228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10643971","Programming competencies;school students;children;professors;scratch;TinkerCAD Arduino;online education","Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Codes;Encoding;Electronic learning","","1","","71","CCBYNCND","23 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study proposes Creative Problem Solving as a framework to improve the way engineering students learn mathematics and support their critical problem solving, communication, and team working skills. The main goal of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using creative problem solving skills through blended learning environment as seen from an Engineering Mathematics students' perspective. First year undergraduate students participated in an experimental group where instruction was provided in a blended learning format using a creative problem solving approach. The lecturer then used face-to-face instruction on the same subject to a control group. Results indicate that from the perspective of the students in the experimental group, the ability to utilize creative problem solving skills is the most important skill set when learning Engineering Mathematics.","","978-1-4577-1259-3","10.1109/ICEED.2011.6235350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235350","Blended Learning;Communication;Creative Problem Solving;Engineering Mathematics;Face-to-face Instruction;Teamwork","Computers;Teamwork;Mathematics;Visualization","","6","","33","IEEE","12 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article claims that reflection constitutes the underlying mechanism, serving as a catalyst for creativity. A total of five experiments is presented, incurred in industrial and academic research environments and pedagogical settings, that demonstrate the occurrence of creativity, deliberately triggered by reflection. The key contribution of this article is that, although the exact definition of creativity continues to elude us, two mechanisms have been uncovered that are potentially useful in triggering creativity, at will, in ordinary scientific and engineering personnel to achieve quantum leaps in our knowledge and achievement. Reflection plays a key, catalytic role in both of these mechanisms and also appears to underlie the inner workings of Nature.","1558-1888","","10.1109/MCD.2004.1263408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263408","","Knowledge engineering;Acoustical engineering;Acoustic reflection;Acoustic noise;Circuit noise;Disk recording;Animals;Personnel;Design engineering;Testing","","1","","31","IEEE","9 Aug 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Constructing Cognitive Reasoning and Decision Making Under Attribute Granular Computing Using Fuzzy Petri Nets","R. Zhou; H. Chang; Y. Zhou; J. Xu; Y. Lu; J.

Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules. Finally, a cognitive reasoning and decision-making model for the formal description of attribute information granules based on the new FPN is constructed, and the proposed case study verifies the feasibility of the proposed method.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2022.3197616","“Blue Fire Plan” (Hiuzhou) Industry-University-Research Joint Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:CXZJHZ201736,CCXZJHZ201815); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B1515120085); Special Projects in Key Fields of Guangdong Province Universities and Colleges(grant numbers:2020ZDZX1023,2021ZDZX1062,2021ZDZX3016); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou(grant numbers:202102080274); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B070702004); Teaching Quality and Reform Project of Guangdong University of Education(grant numbers:2020tszy01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852745","Attribute granular computing (AGrC);cognitive reasoning and decision making;fuzzy Petri net (FPN);qualitative criterion transformation;qualitative mapping","Cognition;Granular computing;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Fuzzy sets;Petri nets;Decision making","","2","","62","IEEE","9 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Duch","Nicolaus Copernicus University, Poland",IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,"23 Jul 2007","2007","2","3","40","52","Can computers have intuition and insights, and be creative? Neurocognitive models inspired by the putative processes in the brain show that these mysterious features are a consequence of information processing in complex networks. Intuition is manifested in categorization based on evaluation of similarity, when decision borders are too complex to be reduced to logical rules. It is also manifested in heuristic reasoning based on partial observations, where network activity selects only those paths that may lead to solution, excluding all bad moves. Insight results from reasoning at the higher, non-verbal level of abstraction that comes from involvement of the right hemisphere networks forming large ""linguistic receptive fields."" Three factors are essential for creativity in invention of novel words: knowledge of word morphology captured in network connections, imagination constrained by this knowledge, and filtering of results that selects the most interesting novel words. These principles have been implemented using a simple correlation-based algorithm for auto-associative memory. Results are surprisingly similar to those created by humans.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2007.385365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274795","","Computational intelligence;Machine intelligence;Artificial intelligence;Information processing;Machinery;Competitive intelligence;Autobiographies;Image analysis;Engines","","33","","65","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story."" (Jenkins 2007) In recent years, this technique is becoming popular in Europe and America. A creator needs to combine ""Flow of story"" and ""Story experience"" at a stage of planning a TMS project. Also, it is hard to build an elaborate plan; the world view of the story, time base, and how to invite the audience to participate in the experience. In this study, we propose the method of visualizing a structure of the entire story with a possible tree-structure model assumed from content elements that users are thinking about when they start to work on a TMS project.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458146","Transmedia storytelling;transmedia;narratology;promotion;advertisement","Visualization;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Europe;Entertainment industry;Planning;Computational intelligence","","1","","22","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in reality, not many learners will acquire the skill of writing source codes. This kind of current situation implies that programming ability of learners cannot be measured by tests that require knowledge. This paper focuses on not only the knowledge items required for programming but also the programming thinking (computational thinking), which is the ability to combine the constituent elements of the program. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the learner’s understanding from the learner’s process to solve the code puzzles that require programming thinking as well as knowledge. We developed the interface to realize the proposed method. The experimental result with the interface showed that the proposed method could estimate with the accuracy of 80% or more.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222990","","Codes;Education;Estimation;Grasping;Writing;Task analysis;Programming profession","","","","14","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to establish a product model that is appropriate for this purpose, they integrated all influencing effects on a product in an influencing space. In order to record content of influencing by engineers and other influencing persons, authorities, etc., the currently prevailing information based product model is completed by representation of information content. This paper emphasizes some relevant issues of information content. Definition of this contents starts from modeling of human intent. Intent model is consists of information about the owner of an intent, characteristics of that intent, and representation of content of intent in some form of knowledge. Information content is organized in the interconnected intent, behavior, and decision spaces. In a hierarchical system, intent space is at the highest and decision space is at the lowest level hierarchy assuring human intent based automation of decision making on engineering object in an improved product model.","","978-1-4244-5310-8","10.1109/ICCCYB.2009.5393938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5393938","Product Lifecycle Management;Product modeling;Human-Computer Interaction;Content based modeling;Decision making in engineering","Humans;Decision making;Recycling;Context modeling;Cybernetics;Informatics;International collaboration;Hierarchical systems;Automation;Content management","","1","","14","IEEE","22 Jan 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
