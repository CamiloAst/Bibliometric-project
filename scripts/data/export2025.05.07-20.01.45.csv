"Sustainable C++ Education in General High School: from Teaching Programming Skills to Developing Computational Thinking","W. Xiduo; L. Jialin; Z.

On one hand, the programming training courses targeted K-12 students have been a big industry; on the other hand, the four editions of the current National High School Information Technology Curriculum textbooks are all in python. Based on the teaching experience of frontline teachers who have been teaching in general high schools for 18 years and the analysis of China's latest curriculum standards and core literacy requirements in information technology, this paper explores how general high schools can achieve sustainable C++ education program. At the curriculum level, combining the characteristics of C++ and students' developmental needs, two series of courses are formed: the General Studies Series and the Competition Series, the General Studies Series feature ""wide range of content"" and ""real problem-driven""; the Competition Series featuring ""deep"" and ""classic problems of computer science algorithms"". At the teaching level, putting ""problem understanding"", ""algorithm design"", ""algorithm experimentation and analysis"" and ""algorithm thinking communication"" at the core of teaching practice, in stages and according to the types of students, differential teaching strategies are adopted, attaching importance to the problem context design and algorithm design, and emphasizing the process of ""computational thinking"" of the students. Only based on the all-round development of students' individuality, adjusting the curriculum and teaching, can the C++ Programming Education of ordinary high school be sustainable.","2473-9464","978-1-7281-7267-5","10.1109/ICCSE49874.2020.9201830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201830","C++ programming education;sustainability;computational thinking","Education;C++ languages;Programming profession;Information technology;Standards","","","","9","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposed a computational thinking model based on blended learning Mctbbl and a descending dimension method for problem-space transformation. The Mctbbl model analyzes and researches the application of computational thinking in computer science by the organic combination of computational thinking and blended learning in a life-cycle perspective. On one hand, the model can summarize the core concepts and important principles in computer science and extract the typical thoughts and general methods of solving problems; on the other hand, the model can implement the teaching and learning of computational thinking by means of blended learning. Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply. The Mctbbl prolongs the study life cycle which takes preview as beginning, teacher-student discussion as body and practical application as core to ensure integrity, endurance and consistency of teaching.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344415","Computational Thinking;Blended learning;Descending dimension;Abstract;Automation","Decision support systems;Education;Handheld computers;Computational modeling;Automation;Scientific computing;Arrays","","1","","20","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Companies are looking for new hires who have the ability to learn how to learn, who have computational thinking skills. Student dropout rate in computer science is the highest among college majors. Educators are striving to find a way to teach efficiently and effectively the technical and the problem solving skills students need. In this paper we will be studying the effects of syntax exercises on a subject's ability to think computationally and precisely. We tested our process on professionals and students. Half of the professionals were in the computer science field and half of our students did syntax exercises. The other half of professionals and students had no exposure to syntax to compare. Our purpose is to find if teaching students syntax exercises are still relevant and can teach both technical and computational thinking skills.","","978-1-6654-8653-8","10.1109/IETC54973.2022.9796660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796660","syntax;precision in thinking;computation thinking;programming;computing eduation","Computer science;Engineering profession;Education;Companies;Syntactics;Computer science education;Problem-solving","","","","17","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33). Mean scores were numerically higher in boys (M =8.71, SD = 2.69) than girls (M =8.05, SD = 2.07). The difference between genders was not significant. The pattern of correct responses to the 15 TechCheck-K items correlated (r =.76) with the pattern observed in first and second graders on the original TechCheck, providing evidence that comparable CT constructs are measured by the two versions of the instrument. Results of this pilot study indicate that TechCheck-K has acceptable characteristics for assessment of CT in kindergarten children.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453926","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453926","Computational thinking;Assessment;Unplugged;Computer Science;Early Childhood Education","Instruments;Conferences;Encoding;Engineering education","","16","","33","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Children with learning disabilities such as autism face challenges in generating suitable and optimal solutions to problems. Those challenges can severely affect their interactions with others. Thus, teaching children with ASD problem solving and computational thinking skills could help them resolve conflicts that may happen in their everyday life. Effective problem solving is critical for their academic and social success and since one of the most effective tools for teaching children with autism is through using visual aids, the work in this paper reports the design and implementation of a serious game that aims at cultivating problem solving skills and teaching programming concepts to children with ASD. The presented game is suitable for children 7 to 14 years of age diagnosed with ASD to learn programming concepts. The preliminary prototype for the game gained positive responses from experts and 12 children with ASD from Caritas Egypt association and Hope Academy.","2375-0138","978-1-7281-9134-8","10.1109/IV51561.2020.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9373147","Computational Thinking;Visual Learners;Children;Autism;Programming","Autism;Visualization;Education;Prototypes;Serious games;Problem-solving;Programming profession","","4","","30","IEEE","11 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
