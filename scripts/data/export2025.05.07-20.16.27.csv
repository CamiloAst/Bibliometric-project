It is considered a cross disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which focuses on nature’s real complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of computing skills acquisition, through problem-based activities to offer powerful knowledge to a wide group of learners. Therefore, quantum technology knowledge should be accessible to students and teachers, in a more interactive way. In this paper, we propose contemporary and Problem based scenarios, in which students may acquire stronger mathematical, computational and modelling skills, working as real researchers. Thus, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to quantum principles, such as superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games we propose, relate to strategic games, within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. Certain Python libraries and packages are used and the didactic approach is based on game-based inquiry learning.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-0001-7","10.1109/ISEC57711.2023.10402296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10402296","Computational Thinking 2.0;Quantum Literacy;Quantum Games;Python","Quantum entanglement;Games;Logic gates;Teleportation;Libraries;Real-time systems;Quantum circuit","","","","43","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational linguists have paid little attention to humor in particular because it is puzzling by nature. However, given the importance of humor in our daily lives and computers in our work and entertainment, studies related to computational humor will become increasingly significant in fields such as human-computer interaction, intelligent interactive entertainment, and computer-assisted education. In this article, we explore computational approaches' applicability to the recognition and use of verbally expressed humor. Particularly, we focus on three important research questions related to this problem: Can we automatically gather large collections of humorous texts? Can we automatically recognize humor in text? And can we automatically insert humorous add-ons into existing applications?","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2006.104","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1705426","computational humor;humor recognition;jokes;one-liners;humor in computer applications","Web pages;HTML;Animal structures;Computational modeling;Computational intelligence;Computer science education;Text recognition;Rhetoric;Training data;Web search","","27","","19","IEEE","2 Oct 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
"Impact of Enhanced Learning Approaches on STEM-Focused Education for School Children in Assam, India","A. Gaur; K. Kalita","School of Agro and Rural Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati, India","2024 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering (TALE)","15 Jan 2025","2024","","","1","8","In today's growing digital era, young students' emphasis on science and technology has multi-folded into the development of computational thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving mindset, and better learning outcomes. Traditionally, young children who tend to perform well academically are expected to become more successful in their careers rather than the skill set they learn and develop their cognition for better opportunities. On the contrary, skill set also plays a significant role in enhancing student engagement towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education. Implementing educational robots and artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms as teaching tools represents a transformative approach to modern teaching methods. Incorporating a fun-based, hands-on learning environment using programming, designing, and problem-solving tasks for students to enhance their cognitive abilities can stimulate curiosity and innovation among them. The novelty of this study is that it analyses two case studies on introducing robotics and artificial intelligence among school children of rural-based schools in Assam, India, which enhances the participating students' self-efficacy, technical knowledge, and problem-solving attitude. This study aims to analyze the impact of an enhanced learning approach on school students regarding knowledge gain, self-worth, and innovative thinking compared to traditional teaching methods. Academicians from the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati have been a part of the sessions provided to children. The data collection and analysis have been approved by the participants and their school teachers. A set of questions was developed to understand some knowledge-based and perception-based parameters through pre/post-tests and draw-a-robot activity. This study demonstrates positive effect sizes (cohen’s d = 1.64 and 5.41) from both case studies and statistic t-values to support the alternate hypothesis on a greater effect of implementing enhanced teaching methods for STEM education.","","979-8-3503-7623-4","10.1109/TALE62452.2024.10834323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10834323","cognitive;computational thinking;educational robot;problem-solving;self-efficacy;STEM;transversal","Technological innovation;Education;Knowledge based systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Robot sensing systems;Teamwork;Sensors;Problem-solving;Programming profession;STEM","","","","27","IEEE","15 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This activity, referred to as #CreaCube, is presented as an open-ended problem which consists of assembling a set of robotic cubes into an autonomous vehicle. We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely, learning science, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving activity is part of an exploratory research action. In addition, an effective proof of concept is described in this study.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2022.3210234","Inria, AEx AIDE (https://team.inria.fr/mnemosyne/en/aide); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904876","Cognitive neuroscience;computational thinking;learning science;ontology;problem solving","Task analysis;Ontologies;Computational modeling;Behavioral sciences;Games;Creativity;Context modeling;Neuroscience;Problem-solving","","","","62","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Bayes’ theorem is taken as a crucial statistical instrument employed in the development of intelligent systems and the management of risks, commonly utilized by engineers for tasks in machine learning and managerial decision-making. The fundamental concept behind Bayes’ theorem revolves around comprehending the degree of truth within the confines of an explicit perspective. This involves partitioning the entire sample space of possible evidence and utilizing the subset containing the relevant perspective to estimate the uncertainty of an event or the reliability of a model. However, it is often found difficult for students to understand Bayes’ theorem to the level of applying it to real-world problems. Considering this, the proposed learning method in this paper elucidated the acquisition of Bayes’ mathematical formulation by leveraging computational thinking, leading to the development of a computational model. The proposed model is named the Bayesian Computational Learning Model (BCLM).

The advantages of using robots include the ability to carry out a psychodrama alone and to provide privacy-friendly support. In the experiment, a scenario was created for medical staff and a robot psychodrama was performed. As a result, we showed that robots can be used for psychodrama and esteem support can be carried out by combination of robots and the chatbot.","","978-1-7281-9048-8","10.1109/SSCI50451.2021.9660118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660118","Robot theater;Empathy map;Stress management;Sense of Coherence","Performance evaluation;Privacy;Coherence;Microcomputers;Chatbots;Mirrors;Robots","","","","37","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
