VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.","2375-5334","978-1-5090-0836-0","10.1109/VR.2016.7504696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7504696","I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism — Virtual Reality;K.3.2 [Computers and Education]: Computer and Information Science Education — Computer Science Education","Education;Programming profession;Virtual reality;Computers;Cognition","","46","","48","IEEE","7 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present an investigation of the psychometric factors that determine the success in this contest, e.g. Abilities in Computational Thinking or intelligence factors. For this purpose, we looked for subsets of Bebras questions that are requiring joint psychometric constructs, according to the responses of the test persons, applying latent trait analysis on all combinations of questions. After identifying suitable sets of questions, we tested the fit of the mono-parametric Rasch Model and evaluated the distribution of person parameters. Additionally, the identified sets of questions were analyzed by qualitative methods to find out the nature of these common psychometric constructs. As a test bed for feasibility studies, we have chosen the Bebras Contests of Germany 2009. We have found and analyzed several sets of questions that met our requirements, analyzed the questions, and identified differences in the performance of boys and girls in these sets.","","978-1-4799-9967-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126233","contest;psychometricconstruct;latent trait analysis","Numerical models;Mathematical model;Joints;Standards;Algorithm design and analysis;Fitting;Computer science","","19","","23","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present study aims to analyze the effects of CT on the academic performance of students in high school. We seek to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) Can CT increase the problem-solving skills of students in high school? (RQ2) Is CT related to the performance of students in high school? (RQ3) Can CT improve the performance of students in high school? We conducted an analysis between two groups of students with similar profiles belonging to the same population, where the factor CT proficiency is the only feature that distinguishes both groups. The results show that there is a moderate correlation between the performance of evaluated students and their skills of CT developed by computer programming. In addition, we found that students proficient in computer programming have superior performance up to 10.2% in ENEM (National Exam of High School) assessment compared to those with little or no experience level and even better performance 21% in the WASI test problem-solving in students on attending high school.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757409","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757409","","Education;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Computers;Mathematics;Sociology","","14","","23","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Context: Mapping and analyzing the diversity of experiences and studies that address CT&P in K-12 education can bring valuable data to researchers. This work delimits such study to the Brazilian scenario to allow a more in-depth view, given the Brazilian context. Previous surveys and systematic mapping studies present recent publications in major Brazilian computing journals and conferences. Although they offer important contributions, they do not comprehensively cover the Brazilian literature on CT&P in K-12 education, since they focus the search in the Brazilian Computer Society publications alone. Objective: This work proposes to characterize the literature on CT&P in K-12 education in Brazil. Results: through a systematic mapping study, we collected information on year, venue, type, K-12 education stage and modality, methodological contexts, and used tools and programming languages from 338 selected primary studies from 2001 until 2016. Conclusions: there is a significant increase in the number of Brazilian studies in the latest years, showing a growing interest on this research area as well as several trends and gaps to be addressed by both researchers and practitioners.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658828","","Education;Programming profession;Tools;Systematics;Data mining;Computer languages","","13","","33","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT involves problem-solving skills based on Computer Science concepts. However, there is no CT formal definition as well as information on how to integrate it with other high school subjects. Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028384","","Robots;Mathematics;Erbium;Education;Problem-solving;Programming","","5","","34","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
