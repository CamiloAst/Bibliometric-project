In this sense, ER has been used to improve educational practices. There are several initiatives that seek to stimulate Computational Thinking (CT) to stand out. Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours. Finally, LEGO® is the most used technology in class.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637185","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637185","","Systematics;Instruments;Education;Debugging;Robot sensing systems;Teamwork;Object recognition","","3","","60","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Computational Modeling of Prefrontal Cortex for Meta-Cognition of a Humanoid Robot","E. Daglarli","Faculty of Computer and Informatics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey",IEEE Access,"3 Jun 2020","2020","8","","98491","98507","For robot intelligence and human-robot interaction (HRI), complex decision-making, interpretation, and adaptive planning processes are great challenges. These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software. Several interaction scenarios are implemented to monitor and evaluate the model's performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998396","NVIDIA Corporation through the GPU Grant Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103513","Artificial intelligence;brain modeling;cognitive robotics;human-robot interaction","Computational modeling;Humanoid robots;Brain modeling;Cognition;Computer architecture;Biological system modeling","","8","","110","CCBY","29 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Math Word Problem Solving with Dual Solving Thinking Structure","H. Wang","School of Artificial Intelligence, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China","2024 5th International Seminar on Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Information Technology (AINIT)","11 Jul 2024","2024","","","706","712","Math Word Problem, abbreviated as MWP, constitute a class of elementary mathematical application scenarios, commonly encountered within primary secondary educational curricula. Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, particularly in achieving notable improvements in solving accuracy for complex problems.","","979-8-3503-8555-7","10.1109/AINIT61980.2024.10581632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10581632","Math Word Problem;artificial intelligence;top-down solver;step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver;dual solving thinking structure","Seminars;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Semantics;Symbols;Mathematical models;Numerical models","","","","18","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMM.2023.3284764","Science and Engineering Research Board(grant numbers:VJR/2019/000009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10209089","","Surveys;Evolution (biology);Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Artificial neural networks;Organisms;Behavioral sciences;Computational intelligence","","3","","71","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The technology is explicitly engineered so that usage is not dependent on having willing teachers as supervisors. Initially targeted at 7-13 year old children, we've had to make adaptations for younger children from the on-site pre-primary school. We describe the innovative mechanism that allows unattended access while securing and protecting our systems.
