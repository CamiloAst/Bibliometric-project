"Fostering Critical and Computational Thinking in the Field of Primary and Secondary Education in non-STEM Subjects by Using Data Sets and Applications","I. Vlahović; I. O. Biškupić","ALGEBRA University College, Zagreb, Croatia; ALGEBRA University College, Zagreb, Croatia",2023 46th MIPRO ICT and Electronics Convention (MIPRO),"29 Jun 2023","2023","","","672","677","Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.","2623-8764","978-953-233-104-2","10.23919/MIPRO57284.2023.10159750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159750","Critical Thinking;Computational Thinking;STEM;non-STEM;Data Science;programming;Python;history;Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes","Correlation;Soft sensors;Education;Social sciences;Data science;History;Pupils","","","","12","","29 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.","2161-377X","978-1-4673-1642-2","10.1109/ICALT.2012.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268116","end-user programming;computational thinking;design thinking;game design environments;informal learning;cognitive walkthrough;cloud-based environments","Games;Programming;Educational institutions;Computers;Context;Tutorials","","5","","15","IEEE","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course. The students in the control group first watched the computational thinking explanation video to explain the computational thinking skills to the students, and then taught in the traditional programming robotics course.","","978-1-6654-4516-0","10.1109/ECICE52819.2021.9645630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645630","Concept mapping;computational thinking;programmed robot 10 pts;intrinsic motivation","Learning systems;Conferences;Computational modeling;Programming;Information age;Robot learning;Problem-solving","","","","25","IEEE","23 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability. It can not only improve learning efficiency, but also train students' computer practical ability. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of this method are verified by Java Web course design.","2474-3828","978-1-7281-3918-0","10.1109/ITME.2019.00078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8964889","Computational Thinking;Practical Thinking;Java Web","Java;Task analysis;Programming;Software;Training;Information technology","","3","","10","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible. Computational Thinking Tools aim to minimize coding overhead by supporting users through three fundamental stages of the Computational Thinking development cycle: problem formulation, solution expression, and solution execution/evaluation.","1943-6106","978-1-5090-0252-8","10.1109/VLHCC.2016.7739688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7739688","computational thinking tools;end-user programming;K-12 education;computational thinking","","","29","","38","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Improving Computational Thinking Competencies in STEM Higher Education","N. Dehbozorgi; M. Roopaei",NA; NA,2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),"17 Sep 2024","2024","","","01","04","Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-5280-1","10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664997","Kennesaw State University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664997","Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Integrated STEM Education;Student Performance","Surveys;Industries;Computational modeling;Focusing;Logic gates;Cognition;Pattern recognition","","1","","12","IEEE","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
