Abstraction and automation are the core of computational thinking. Therefore, CT is the key skill in Industry 4.0. However, in Malaysia's manufacturing, only 50 percent of SMEs deploy automation. Automation can make the company more efficient, more accurate and decrease human error. CT was built based on 4 basic pillars which are abstraction, decomposition, algorithm and pattern recognition. These pillars will encourage automation, efficiency, and innovation. Moreover, one of the benefits of CT for nonprogrammer is the formulated problem can be passed on to information-processing agents such as third-party companies or freelancers who can create the solution. In this paper, we review the benefits of computational thinking in entrepreneurship in the context of Industry 4.0.","2324-8157","978-1-7281-6726-8","10.1109/ICRIIS48246.2019.9073671","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9073671","computational thinking;industry 4.0;automation;entrepreneurship;small and medium enterprise","Entrepreneurship;Computed tomography;Industries;Automation;Technological innovation;Computers","","3","","68","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344115","computer science education;computer programming understanding;abstract thinking;gender difference;software metric","Programming profession;Computers;Education;Software metrics;Software;Computer languages","","1","","24","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Container terminal logistics scheduling and decision-making within the conceptual framework of computational thinking","B. Li","School of Transportation, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China",2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),"11 Feb 2016","2015","","","330","337","The optimal paradigm and systematic solution to scheduling and decision-making for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high nolinear and complexity and the strong coupling and randomness. In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.","","978-1-4799-7886-1","10.1109/CDC.2015.7402222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402222","","Containers;Logistics;Computational modeling;Marine vehicles;Complexity theory;Computers;Planning","","12","","10","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical & Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.","2153-0033","978-1-5386-2775-4","10.1109/AFRCON.2017.8095566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095566","computer science (CS);creative thinking;quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM);Raspberry Pi (RasPi);science-technology-engineering-mathematics (STEM)","Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Interpolation;Image reconstruction;Mathematical model;Green products;Lattices","","1","","20","IEEE","7 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
