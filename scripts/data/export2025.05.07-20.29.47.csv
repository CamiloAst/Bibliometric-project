In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>","","0-8186-8860-2","10.1109/ARRAYS.1988.18056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=18056","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Computer science;Fast Fourier transforms;Cache storage;Computer networks;Pipelines;Arithmetic;Predictive models;Partial differential equations","","","","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Cultivating creativity (and majors) with computational craft","S. Reiser; R.

Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.","1558-058X","978-1-4799-6585-4","10.1109/SECON.2014.6950654","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950654","creativity;computer science education;disability;diversity;fabrication","Art;Computer science;Fabrication;Three-dimensional displays;Computers;Education;Metals","","","","5","IEEE","10 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They retain data for immediate and delayed processing, and they store the results of processing for later retrieval. All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing. Let's take a look at developments that bring processing and memory/storage together in new ways to enable smarter consumer devices.","2162-2256","","10.1109/MCE.2019.2892249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8684802","","Logic gates;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Data processing;Data centers;Memory management;Neurons","","3","","2","IEEE","9 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning.

"Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements","M. Andrzejewska; A.

One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981","Scientific Research Fund of the Pedagogical University of Krakow; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994685","Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems","Flowcharts;Codes;Gaze tracking;Task analysis;Computer languages;Education;Programming profession","","3","","40","CCBY","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved.

Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343492","robotic coding;digital storytelling;action research;participatory design;and computational thinking","Learning systems;Three-dimensional displays;Soft sensors;Prototypes;Encoding;Reflection;Problem-solving","","1","","27","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936919","IDiLyCo Project; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(grant numbers:TIN2015-66655-R); Project FEI INVITAR-IA of the University Complutense of Madrid; Andalusian Government under the University of Cadiz Programme for Researching and Innovation in Education 2015/2016(grant numbers:SOL-201500054211-TRA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811517","Narrative construction;draft revision;empirical observation;computational storytelling;cognitive models","Computational modeling;Task analysis;Writing;Planning;Receivers;Biological system modeling;Solid modeling","","","","32","CCBY","23 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
