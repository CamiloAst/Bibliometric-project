With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.","2577-1647","978-1-7281-4878-6","10.1109/IECON.2019.8927169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8927169","Programming fundamentals;Logical Thinking;extra-curricular activities;technology mindset;Micro-controller;Puzzle Representation","Syntactics;Games;Tools;Programming profession;Automobiles;Light emitting diodes","","","","23","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.","","978-1-5090-2873-3","10.1109/CDC.2017.8264038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264038","Rational Choice theory;Computational social choice;Distributed hypothesis testing;Bayesian inference;Computational complexity;Bayesian computations","Bayes methods;Nickel;Economic indicators;History;Computational complexity;Conferences","","3","","22","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwu022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155009","development frameworks and environments;designing software;interactive learning environments;computational thinking;informal learning","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.","2156-8111","979-8-3503-2743-4","10.1109/ACII59096.2023.10388119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388119","affective computing;GPT-3.5;GPT-4;large language models;appraisal theory","Emotion recognition;Affective computing;Computational modeling;Cognition;Appraisal","","7","","37","IEEE","15 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Natural Language Programming with TryPL","J. Keene; H. M.

The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.","2161-377X","978-1-6654-9519-6","10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853848","Natural Language;Computational Thinking;Conceptual Programming;eLearning;Logic First Syntax Later","Java;Codes;Instruments;Natural languages;Syntactics;Impedance;Programming profession","","2","","8","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2873642","China NSFC(grant numbers:61802261); Shenzhen University(grant numbers:2018061); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 21203516); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11217817); Singapore MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2016-T2-2-023); NTU CoE(grant numbers:M4081879); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481440","Traffic estimation;graph-parallel processing;non-linear correlation modeling","Roads;Estimation;Correlation;Computational modeling;Public transportation;Urban areas;Probes","","39","","52","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.","","978-1-5090-0641-0","10.1109/WACV.2016.7477725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477725","","Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Transmission line matrix methods;Computational modeling;Cameras;Solid modeling;Deformable models","","12","","42","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.","","978-1-4244-7376-2","10.1109/NABIC.2010.5716278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5716278","Artificial Social Intelligence;Distributed Intelligent Systems;Multi-agent Systems;Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture;Social Cognition;Social Regression;Anthropology","Biological system modeling;Mixers;Computational modeling;Switches;Analytical models","","1","","16","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.","","978-1-5090-2504-6","10.1109/LaTiCE.2016.1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7743145","Gender Differences;Biographies;Computer Science Education","Computers;Biographies;Programming;Games;Engineering profession;Computational modeling","","18","","18","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
