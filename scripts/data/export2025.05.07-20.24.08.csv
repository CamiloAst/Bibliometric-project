"Deployment of physics simulation apps using Easy JavaScript Simulations","",,2017 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),"8 Jun 2017","2017","","","1093","1096","Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android. The generation process is based on the integration of the Ionic/Cordova and AngularJS technologies into EjsS. Finally, we present several working examples based on the works of Open Source Physics at Singapore.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942985","Simulations;Mobile Technologies;Hybrid Apps;EjsS;Computational Thinking","Computational modeling;Physics;Mathematical model;Tools;Adaptation models;Smart phones;Engineering education","","2","","9","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"On the fusion and transference of knowledge. II","S. H. Rubin","SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego, CA, USA",Proceedings Fifth IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications,"8 Jan 2004","2003","","","150","159","Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, ""a society of mind"". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.","","0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251408","","Reflection;Working environment noise;Humans;Vehicles;Object oriented modeling;Cost function;Neural networks;Operational amplifiers;Ontologies;USA Councils","","","","27","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We developed a game where a robot has to assemble a sandwich, collecting a specific list of ingredients. Our game follows principles and offers game mechanics typical of games for learning programming. The main innovation of our game is that it visualizes the generality property of algorithms through double levels, that we call twin-worlds, in which one same algorithm is executed by two robots in assembling their sandwiches. Results from early testing with university students enrolled in the education of Media Studies show that the game is usable, levels can be solved at various degrees of complexity (e.g. with and without using loops), and that the students were able to make sense of our twin-worlds levels and formulate general algorithms for both worlds. However, the gathered feedback also highlights the need to explore alternative implementations of the twin-worlds concept.","2472-0070","978-1-6654-9755-8","10.1109/IIAIAAI55812.2022.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894608","Computational Thinking;Games;Programming;Computational Problems;Gaming Experience;Netnography","Visualization;Technological innovation;Codes;Prototypes;Games;Robot sensing systems;Complexity theory","","","","18","IEEE","23 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fuzzy ADBEL is a computational model that models the forgetting process and inhibitory mechanism of the emotional brain. In the model, the fuzzy decay rate simulates the forgetting process, and the stimulus and learning weights are considered as fuzzy variables trained by fuzzy learning rules. The final output of the model is evaluated by a fuzzy decision making layer that simulates the inhibitory mechanism. The proposed Fuzzy ADBEL is utilized to predict the Kp, AE and Dst indices showing opposite behaviors and characterizing the chaotic activity of the earth's magnetosphere. Experimental results show that fuzzy approaches including Fuzzy ADBEL and ANFIS (Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System) reaches steady state faster than non-fuzzy approaches, ADBEL and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). Hence, we hope the proposed model can be used in real time chaotic time series prediction.","1098-7584","978-1-4799-0022-0","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2013.6622510","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622510","BELBIC;BEL;ADBEL;Limbic;Amygdala;Fuzzy emotion;Forecast;Computational model","Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Steady-state;Adaptation models;Indexes;Time series analysis;Prediction algorithms","","13","","42","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, scientists have found evidence for existence of distinct behavioral control systems shared by humans and nonhumans. Inspired by the problem solving systems of the behavioral control in the primate brain, a hierarchical computational model is presented. We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027355","Yiwu Industrial and Commercial College(grant numbers:ZD2020JD602-04); Key Project of Jinhua Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:2020-1-001); U.S. ONR(grant numbers:N00014-08-1-0693); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207882","Cognitive hierarchical architecture;computational model;reinforcement learning;local and global planning","Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Problem-solving;Control systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Cognition;Psychology","","2","","31","CCBY","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
