End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9747320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9747320","speech summarization;end-to-end;long sequence modeling;concept learning","Text recognition;Computational modeling;Memory management;Speech recognition;Predictive models;Signal processing;Transformers","","14","","30","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is very important to have a reliable service. Up to 1000 km, trains and buses play the main role in the public transport. The number of the people and which kind of transport they prefer is important information for transport operators. In this paper is proposed algorithm for transport modeling and passenger flow, based on Ant Colony Optimization method. The problem is described as multi-objective optimization problem. There are two optimization purposes: minimal transportation time and minimal price. Some fuzzy element is included. When the price is in a predefined interval it is considered the same. Similar for the starting traveling time. The aim is to show how many passengers will prefer train and how many will prefer buses according their preferences, the price or the time.","","978-83-955416-7-4","10.15439/2020F15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222875","","Economics;Computer science;Ant colony optimization;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Transportation;Linear programming","","4","","13","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"ICT4D 2.0 studies in virtual environment: Context and user needs to foster learning process","N. Mavengere; M. Ruohonen","University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland; University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland",2016 IST-Africa Week Conference,"8 Aug 2016","2016","","","1","8","The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.","","978-1-9058-2455-7","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2016.7530608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530608","virtual learning;user needs in virtual learning;context in virtual learning;virtual learning review;information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course","Context;Virtual environments;Information and communication technology;Education;Collaboration;Internet;Computational modeling","","3","","8","","8 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.","2643-2447","979-8-3503-1882-1","10.1109/SCOReD60679.2023.10563364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10563364","Artificial Intelligence;Neural Network;Machine Learning;Blockchain;Decentralized;AI model;Resource pooling;Open-Source;Monopolization;ChatGPT;GPT-4;M6;Free-to-use AI;NLP","Training;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Transforms;Blockchains;Stakeholders;Security","","1","","19","IEEE","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.","","978-1-5090-2714-9","10.1109/ICRMS.2016.8050072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050072","testability modeling;testability analysis;FMECA;multi-signal model","Analytical models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Signal processing;Testing;Fault detection;Data models","","1","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models.
