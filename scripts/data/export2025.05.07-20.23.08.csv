There are advantages in many aspects, but traditional competitive thinking should still be the dominant training method."" At the same time, the degree of similarity of the team’s competitive thinking model has different effects on team performance obvious to see. When the basketball team’s overall competitive thinking pattern is more similar, team performance is also more significant.","","978-1-6654-3829-2","10.1109/ICISE-IE53922.2021.00368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742343","Simulation;competitive state;influencing factors;regulation methods","Training;Information science;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Prototypes;Software;Sports","","","","6","IEEE","29 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Situation assessment in computational semiotics","C. Landauer","Aerospace Integration Science Center, Aerospace Corporation, Los Angeles, CA, USA",Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control (ISIC) held jointly with IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation (CIRA) Intell,"6 Aug 2002","1998","","","712","717","This paper is about a particular technical problem in the study of autonomy in computational systems: how can a computing system invent and use its own symbols and symbol construction mechanisms? We think this invention is necessary for intelligent behavior in any organism, artificial or otherwise, since it has been observed repeatedly that systems with fixed symbol sets get stuck. This observation is well-known in computing circles, and has been observed in ""extensible"" languages, large and growing knowledge bases, content-based filing systems for technical literature, and inheritance hierarchies for large object-oriented systems: no matter what elaboration mechanisms are used, no matter what initial structures are used, the structures eventually become too constrained by what is already there, and stagnate. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms (which include the alphabet, as the mechanisms for constructing expressions from nothing), that is, the basic units that combine or are combined to make the structures, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which for us is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas, since the questions are very hard and have no easy answers.","2158-9860","0-7803-4423-5","10.1109/ISIC.1998.713807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713807","","Postal services;Computational and artificial intelligence;Organisms;Knowledge based systems","","3","","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Evaluating the Aesthetics of Endgame Studies: A Computational Model of Human Aesthetic Perception","A. Iqbal; H. van der Heijden; M. Guid; A.

Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2192933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177652","Aesthetics;chess;creativty;endgame;perception","Humans;Games;Computational modeling;Computers;Adaptation models;Materials;Artificial intelligence","","12","","28","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190652","","Instruments;Correlation;Programming profession;Problem-solving","","21","","24","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes. A dataset from five different assignments, including open-ended problems, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our autograder. Our initial experiments show that our method can classify the students' submissions even for open-ended problems, where existing autograders fail to do so. Additionally, survey responses from course teachers support the importance of our work.","","978-1-4503-9336-2","10.1145/3528231.3528357","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1923573); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814929","open-ended problems;code quality;lexical analysis;machine learning","Visualization;Codes;Conferences;Education;Manuals;Next generation networking;Testing","","2","","34","","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of having described the different functional parts of the proposed algorithm, two kinds of simulative experiments about completion time and cost of tasks are conducted. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.","","978-0-7695-3490-9","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756889","grid computing;resource scheduling;load balancing;economy","Load management;Resource management;Processor scheduling;Grid computing;Quality of service;Environmental economics;Distributed computing;Job shop scheduling;Scheduling algorithm;Local area networks","","2","","7","IEEE","20 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
