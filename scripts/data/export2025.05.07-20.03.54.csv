The learner is modeled on the basis of knowledge from learning sciences with the contribution of cognitive neurosciences, including machine learning formalism, in the very precise framework of a task, named #CreaCube reviewed here, related to initiation to computational thinking presented as an open-ended problem, which involves solving a problem and appealing to creativity. We target problem-solving tasks using tangible interfaces for computational thinking initiation, and describe in details how we model the task and the learner behavior in this task, including goal-driven versus stimulus-driven behavior and the learner knowledge construction. We show how formalizing these elements using an ontology offers a well-defined computational model and the possibility of inferences about model elements, analyzing and predicting the learner behavior. This operationalization of a creative problem-solving task is still at a preliminary stage, but an effective proof of concept is described in this study.","","978-1-7281-6242-3","10.1109/ICDL49984.2021.9515660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515660","Cognitive Neuroscience;Ontology;Problem-Solving;Learning Sciences;Computational Thinking","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Conferences;Machine learning;Predictive models;Ontologies;Problem-solving","","4","","25","IEEE","20 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational literacy is an important ability to understand and communicate information in current digital age and ubiquitous age. The digital has been used as a tool of communication along with language. Therefore, we would need to have ability to express our idea and understand an other's presentation with language and digital, which is just computational Literacy. However, most educators focus on using computer and internet, not computational literacy. Therefore, we define the operational definition about computational literacy suited for the present age by analyzing existing computational Literacy. In addition, we extract educational factors from the relation with computational thinking that is the purpose of computational literacy. Finally, we discuss teaching-learning strategy of computational literacy for all level s of students.","","978-1-4244-5209-5","10.1109/NCM.2009.192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5331425","Computational Literacy Education;Computational Thinking","Pervasive computing;Computer science education;Internet;Arithmetic;Writing;Communications technology;Computer network management;Knowledge management;Technology management;Information analysis","","","","17","IEEE","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, only recently games that teach coding and algorithmic thinking or even broader, computational thinking, emerged. Initiatives like Hour of Code and similar online activities or block-based programming games popularized the field, while at the same time, projects like CSUnplugged showed that the “idea of programming” can be learned even without using the computer. In this paper, we present our experience so far in creating and implementing different unplugged activities that teach students of different age levels, from early primary school to the university students, the simple programming concepts and algorithms. As a part of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (STEM-C) outreach program named SUZA - From school to science and the academic community at University of Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Croatia, we conducted a number of game-like activities based on graph paper programming, block-based programming and using the existing board games. Although this is a work in progress project, the participant reactions so far, collected through interviews and questionnaires, indicated that the conducted activities were well accepted by students and their teachers. We also received a number of useful feedback comments and proposals, such as to expand the activities to include the homework part, or to make them more physical and relocate them outdoors.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659077","STEM-C;computational thinking;algorithmic thinking;unplugged programming;education","Games;Programming profession;Conferences;Education;Shape;Electrical engineering","","11","","17","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the proposed model, a knowledge modeling language (Design Mental Modeling Language, DMML) is developed for expressing and reasoning the design thinking process explicitly. Semi-formal structure is used by DMML, which can improve both the expressiveness and computability of this language. A visual modeling system is developed for implementing DMML and an example is presented for illustration.","","978-1-4577-1079-7","10.1109/CAD/Graphics.2011.56","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062764","design thinking process;knowledge representation;modeling language;design intent","Computational modeling;Grammar;Unified modeling language;Cognition;Solid modeling;Computers;Visualization","","1","","9","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, Computational Thinking, as a problem-solving approach that can involve information technologies, can contribute a lot to this subject. Therefore, due to its essence, the development of Computer Science concepts is closely related to the employment of problem-solving activities. However, teachers may face difficulties when proposing Computational Thinking problem-solving activities to their students. This paper proposes the engineering of a software that aims to allow teachers to generate challenges related to game and interactive animations programming to support their classes. The problems generated by the system, do not limit the learners' creative power. Besides that, teachers can balance the reasoning component of the challenges according to the learners' level of knowledge in programming and algorithms.

Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274250","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274250","computational thinking;first-year engineering education;learning and teaching effectiveness;assessment metrics","Programming profession;Organizations;Engineering students;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Tools;Pattern matching","","6","","39","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
