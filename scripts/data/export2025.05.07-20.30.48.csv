"Modeling At School – On the Benefits and Skill Development of the Use of Modeling Diagrams at School","J. Moreno-León; C. Chushig; G.

In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766646","Erasmus; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766646","modeling;computational thinking;skill development;diagrams","Adaptation models;Systematics;Computational modeling;Conferences;Unified modeling language;Complexity theory;Problem-solving","","1","","22","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The very complex interactions and interdependencies among power market participants are much like those studied in game theory. However, the strategies used by market participants are often too complex to be conveniently modelled by standard game theoretic techniques. In addition, there has been much less research in the field of dynamic strategic behaviour and their impact on the electricity price in European markets. In this paper, we show new, prosperous combination of computational science and new ideas in evolutionary economics and cognitive science offering appealing extensions to traditional game theoretical modelling. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing our approach in Matlab using learning algorithm and illustrate its advantages in more detailed and realistic representation of the strategic behaviour of biggest power producers in European power market.","","1-4244-0049-X","10.1109/EURCON.2005.1630243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630243","Agent- Based Simulation;Electricity price;Learning algorithm;Power markets;Transmission grid","Power markets;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Power generation economics;Mathematical model;Power system modeling;Fuel economy;Electricity supply industry;Environmental economics;Power system simulation","","4","","7","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we put our focus on narrative creation and propose that a Picture-Attributed-Note (PAN) framework can help with writing job. Picture and attributed notes were used to present and record story elements and to stimulate creativity. The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1]. The results reveal that the PAN system helps stimulate user's creativity and did not change their main creating process. In addition, the user interface of the PAN system could allow the user to concentrate more on the writing creation process.","","978-1-4673-6010-4","10.1109/CICAC.2013.6595219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595219","creativity;computer-aided system;digital narrative;cognition process","Writing;Computers;User interfaces;Encoding;Computational intelligence;Affective computing;Buffer storage","","","","41","IEEE","12 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.","","979-8-3503-7069-0","10.1109/ICETA61311.2023.10343894","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343894","","Art;Education;Urban areas;Software;Planning;Informatics;Robots","","","","21","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Within this context, appropriate learning environments are planned to shape future Information and Communication Technology staff in such a way they could get able to keep up with new trends and innovations. A constructivist educational model based on Active Learning represents a step towards this vision for staff training. This paper deals with a new organization of a 13 weeks course based on the inverted class model, where students are introduced to the problem-posing domain by a direct involvement of enterprises, which participate specifically to the problem definition and assessment phases. In the case study shown, students simulate a production business unit in all the phases that characterize the product/service development life cycle. A mixed traditional and company-based organization of the course is supposed to improve students competences by proposing solutions leveraging on appropriate tools taken from traditional experiences and also gaining benefits from a learning-by-doing approach that encourages the use of state-of-the-art solutions. A preliminary study is performed to see how expected professional competences are met during the course, with the additional goal of collecting indications that could help to improve the learning framework for future editions of the course.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-6564-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2015.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7273712","Active Learning;Inquiry-Based Learning;Computational Thinking;Problem-Posing and Problem-Solving;Company-based Learning","Context;Companies;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Unified modeling language","","4","","29","IEEE","24 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied application that targets to classify the data captured by multiple wearable sensors into one of a predefined set of activity classes. Earlier approaches in the area relied on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, while many researchers proposed solutions based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Convolution Neural Network (CNNs). Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community. This is of paramount importance if we consider that wearables are characterized by scarce memory and computational resources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of the size of the various CNN components (focusing on the convolution and dense layers) to the model validation performance. As a second step, we focus on two CNN models with diverse memory characteristics (the lean and the fat model) and we employ three different compression techniques (Filter-Based Pruning –FBP,– Low Rank Factorization –LRF,– and dynamic range quantization) assuming various compressibility scenarios.","2326-0319","979-8-3503-0498-5","10.23919/SPA59660.2023.10274441","Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10274441","","Performance evaluation;Analytical models;Quantization (signal);Convolution;Wearable computers;Computational modeling;Signal processing algorithms","","2","","38","","10 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
