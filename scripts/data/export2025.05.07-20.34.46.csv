Historically, access to this discipline has been redirected to STEM professionals. However, the ubiquity of cloud computing and the simplicity of modern programming languages such as Python and R have enabled non-STEM students and professionals to leverage it especially to analyze data. Similarly, with what has been conveyed with computational thinking in terms of enabling non-STEM students with com technological competencies, this article aims to present a proposal for improving the teaching of data science specifically to non-stem students.","","978-1-4503-9345-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852919","Data Science;non-STEM;computational thinking","Industries;Cloud computing;Education;Data science;Libraries;Proposals;Python","","","","22","","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two of the authors have been involved in the re-design, implementation and execution of a basic programming and CT course, offered to first-semester students as part of the Information science, IT and interaction design bachelor program, at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). The central problem we faced in restructuring our introductory course, was finding a game genre that could support creative coding for beginners, be motivational and recognizable by the students, and would work with our use-modify-create learning approach. Our findings suggest that point-and-click games are an effective way to provide scaffolding and ease non-technical students into P5 programming. The genre has good expressive power, and the students were motivated because they recognized and could relate to the games they worked on. Future work will address students’ problems with scaling up the point-and-click games.","2472-0070","979-8-3503-2422-8","10.1109/IIAI-AAI59060.2023.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371611","Computational Thinks;Scaffolding;Humanities;Introduction to Programming;P5","Information science;Humanities;Face recognition;Games;Encoding;Informatics;Programming profession","","","","17","IEEE","29 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620555","NSF(grant numbers:1923606); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620555","teacher professional development;elementary school;computational thinking;equity and inclusion","Computer science;Education;Buildings;Reflection;Interviews","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students have exerted a dedication effort and enjoyed digital craft especially while using Arduino despite the virtual teaching classes. Kinetic applications have received students' total endorsement and hands-on involvement supported with theoretical lectures focusing on fabrication techniques, materials and tools along with parametric algorithmic design. Assignments are both structured and semi-structured to promote their skills and grant them a free-flexible pedagogical approach.","","979-8-3503-0030-7","10.1109/LT58159.2023.10092318","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10092318","Digital fabrication;Arduino application;Computational Pedagogy;IOT;Interactive design","Fabrication;Visualization;Heuristic algorithms;Education;Focusing;Kinetic theory;Sensors","","","","25","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education. The simulation results demonstrate the system's superior performance in precision, accuracy, efficiency, productivity, learning score, and student performance score.","","979-8-3503-5976-3","10.1109/ICERCS57948.2023.10434101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10434101","Modern art education;Blockchain;fuzzy system;artificial intelligence","Productivity;Visualization;Art;Systematics;Education;Blockchains;Task analysis","","","","15","IEEE","21 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In personalized education, each student is given a curriculum based on what they already know and how well they understand. To achieve its rapid and productive activity, a large-scale data analysis model for tracking the creative and entrepreneurial skills of college students is dependent on the balance and synergy of aspects such as different learning, finance, and institutional frameworks. As a result, in this research, a Big Data-assisted Thinking Skill Analysis Model (BD-TSAM) is presented to analyze students' innovative thinking skills and improve entrepreneurial skills through tailored education. This study creates a sophisticated and varied learning resource that continuously records and analyses student data. It provides tailored training, personalized learning, and dependable real-time services through technical support that uses big data to increase Entrepreneurship abilities. BD-TSAM enhances students' distinctive social and autonomous entrepreneurship learning by providing adaptive learning services. BD-TSAM intelligently creates a learning paradigm that is appropriate for each student and actually implements tailored learning for instilling entrepreneurial abilities. Comparing the suggested BD-TSAM model to other models already in use, the experimental results demonstrate that it increases the student learning rate by 94.6%, assessment rate by 95.2%, F-measure ratio by 96.6%, student performance ratio by 98.1%, decision-making rate by 99.1%, and employment ratio by 98.9%.","","979-8-3315-3496-7","10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10895587","Big data Analytics;personalized education;student performance;Entrepreneurship skills","Training;Technological innovation;Analytical models;Adaptation models;Scientific computing;Employment;Entrepreneurship;Big Data;Real-time systems;Libraries","","","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
