"When Does Collaborative Interaction Support Learning of Computational Thinking Among Undergraduate Students","B. Chowdhury; D. Kafura; A. Johri","Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech; Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech; Department of Information Sciences & Technology, George Mason University",2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"29 Nov 2022","2022","","","1","7","Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962505","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962505","Computational Thinking;Collaboration;Undergraduate Instruction;Qualitative Research;Data Science","Codes;Federated learning;Semantics;Collaboration;Writing;Syntactics;Problem-solving","","","","21","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then present this model with formulae using a top-down approach. We propose that the human thought process, which is the fundamental unit for the human mind and all the different emotions coming from it, can be implemented as a mathematical formula to a reasonable extent. Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking. The model utilizes a top-down approach for understanding the factors involved in the thought process while explaining the factors involved. The authors are intending to make continuous improvements in the formulae as more scientific advances happen in the understanding of the human cognitive functions.","","979-8-3503-2776-2","10.1109/ICE3IS59323.2023.10335478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10335478","human thoughts;cognitive systems;formulae;neuro-modeling;top-down approach;computational intelligence;machine learning;neurons","Electrical engineering;Computers;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Mathematical models;Continuous improvement;Intelligent systems","","","","40","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9943-1","10.1109/EDUCON54358.2023.10125266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10125266","Quantum Games;Quantum Literacy;Computational Thinking 2.0;Python","Quantum computing;Quantum entanglement;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Games;Logic gates;Teleportation","","","","45","IEEE","22 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This exploratory quasi-experimental study examined the effects of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (CCL) on students’ learning performance, artificial intelligence (AI) awareness, critical thinking, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduates participated in an eight-week instructional experiment, dedicating 3 h per week to applying STEM and entrepreneurship knowledge in the creation of cultural products. The experimental group (N = 21) participated in CCL, while the control group (N = 15) engaged in non-ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (NCCL). The results indicated that the CCL group outperformed the NCCL group in terms of learning performance, AI awareness, and cognitive load, while the NCCL group excelled in critical thinking. The findings confirm that ChatGPT offers significant potential and advantages in addressing complex problems within group collaboration and stimulating group creativity, providing new insights into fostering students’ entrepreneurial spirit and skills. However, overreliance on and misuse of ChatGPT may hinder student learning outcomes. Future research should focus on the cocreative problem-solving mechanisms between humans and machines in entrepreneurial education, particularly the interplay of knowledge, thinking, emotions, and actions in collaborative processes involving GAI.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2025.3554584","2024 Guangdong Province Undergraduate Universities Teaching Quality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10938864","Artificial intelligence (AI) awareness;ChatGPT;cognitive load;critical thinking;learning performance;STEM and entrepreneurship education","Chatbots;Entrepreneurship;Artificial intelligence;Collaboration;Federated learning;Human-machine systems;Cognitive load;Cultural differences;Creativity;Training","","","","69","IEEE","26 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Using Topic Modeling to Extract Pre-Service Teachers’ Understandings of Computational Thinking From Their Coding Reflections","M. Cutumisu; Q. Guo","Department of Educational Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Department of Educational Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",IEEE Transactions on Education,"30 Oct 2019","2019","62","4","325","332","Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2019.2925253","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RES0034954); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Killam Trusts(grant numbers:RES0043207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760527","Computational thinking;computing skills;educational technology;higher education;pre-service teachers;problem solving;programming;topic modeling","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Problem-solving;Education;Tools;Encoding;Data mining","","25","","60","IEEE","12 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
