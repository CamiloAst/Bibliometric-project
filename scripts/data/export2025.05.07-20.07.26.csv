When nurturing identity and empowerment, it is a persistent challenge to provide youth with real-world experiences and suitable development tools. This paper advances two key approaches to address these issues: 1) A critical computational literacy approach to engage youth in developing personally meaningful applications that have impact in the real world; 2) the use of a tool, like MIT App Inventor, that lowers barriers to creating useful, impactful technology. Using two case-based studies, we show how these two approaches have supported youth in developing applications that respond to meaningful challenges in their communities and helped them to establish their computational identities and digital empowerment.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943078","computational thinking;digital empowerment;computational identity","Computer languages;Tools;Encoding;Context;Engineering education;Conferences","","17","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently the serious limitations of the computational processing methods have been found through the development of the highly intelligent user interface systems. The simple solutions to the limitations are the return to the symbolism or the use of the hierarchical system architecture. However it is indispensable deeply to combine the symbolic and computational processing in order to realize the highly intelligent system. The leading attempts toward the combination of computational and symbolic processing are overviewed. The level of the combination is not deep, high and wide enough. Our approach based on the emergent recurrent neural network and the language processing toward the deep fusion of symbolic and computational processing is proposed. In this new architecture, the symbolic processing and the computational processing should affect each other at anytime, at anywhere and at any abstract level.","1098-7584","0-7803-4863-X","10.1109/FUZZY.1998.687581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=687581","","User interfaces;Intelligent systems;Computational intelligence;Computer architecture;Computer interfaces;Hierarchical systems;Computer networks;Information systems;Electronic mail;Recurrent neural networks","","2","","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the definition, classification and function of design sketch are explained. Secondly, its importance in the product design process is analyzed. Then design sketch is compared with computer rendering. The uncertainty of design sketch is presented to reveal its ambiguity. Thirdly, the relationship between the ambiguity of design sketch and creative thinking is discussed. Finally, the teaching points of design sketch are proposed from two aspects of presentation techniques and training contents. Appropriate drawing tools and techniques should be chosen according to the characteristics of different stages of the design process and progressive training should be insisted on, so that design sketch can really serve as a primer for the successive courses of product design.","","978-1-4244-7974-0","10.1109/CAIDCD.2010.5681346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681346","design sketch;creative thinking;ambiguity;design sketch teaching","Computational modeling;Three dimensional displays;Shape;Universal Serial Bus;Solid modeling;Visualization","","","","5","IEEE","6 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry. In this paper, the CDIO model is detailed as a means of transforming engineering education on a large scale. In order to develop the fundamental framework of creative awareness sessions for quantum technologies and their applications, this study attempted to further explore and provide more specific illustrations of the concepts relating to CIDO and to consider how they may be applied within an engineering context. The current work will present and evaluate the principles of an innovative teaching technique aimed at providing students with the opportunities to understand pioneering technologies for future applications.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578801","education research schemes;education in the industry 5.0 era;design thinking and innovation for education;Remote Classrooms","Couplings;Knowledge engineering;Technological innovation;Visualization;Qubit;Entrepreneurship;Telecommunications","","","","10","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A high percentage of the research nowadays focuses on how to impart knowledge of computer in the perspective of computational thinking. But more importantly, the research ignores an important way to train thinking - practice. This paper starts with the “College Computer Curriculum”, which is the first computer course for undergraduate students. By using virtual reality technology, this paper gives the college teacher an experimental design method of “College Computer Curriculum”. Some exploratory research works have been performed to explain how to embody the basic problems of computer public course. Finally, we introduce a set of virtual experiment libraries, which are independent research and development.

We created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD) as an instructional tool that can identify at-risk first-year engineering students. The purpose of this study is to provide construct validity, internal consistency reliability, item characteristics, and criterion validity evidence for this diagnostic. From fall 2020 to fall 2021, 469 students from three institutions in the United States took the diagnostic. The data from 152 students at one institution was used to provide evidence of predictive validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in 20 items loading onto one factor in a good model fit range, with the internal consistency reliability coefficient, Cronbach  $\alpha $  of 0.86. From item analyses based on classical test theory, the diagnostic items on average tended to be slightly easy but had sufficient discrimination power. The correlation matrix for criterion validity evidence indicated that the diagnostic functions well to differentiate students’ computational thinking ability by prior computer science course experience as well as by first-generation status. Predictive validity evidence from regression analyses revealed the statistically significant effect of students’ diagnostic scores assessed at the beginning of the first semester on predicting their end of semester course grades. The ECTD can have a broad impact because it provides a tool to gauge the entry-level skills of students, enabling early curriculum interventions to help retention and persistence to graduation. We make the case that the ECTD could contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce in engineering.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335931","United States National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1949880,1917354,1917352); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10327734","Computer science education;computational thinking;diagnostic method;student assessment tools;engineering education;first-year engineering student experience;quantitative research methods;retention;validity;factor analysis","Reliability;Instruments;Engineering students;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Reliability engineering;Analytical models;Computer science education;User experience","","1","","89","CCBYNCND","23 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the framework of CCEs is described, and the results of two separate studies on their impact on student achievement are presented. Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles. The CCEs appear to be a promising way to increase student achievement in introductory CS courses.
