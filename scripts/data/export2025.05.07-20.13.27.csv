"Modeling a Problem-Solving Approach Through Computational Thinking for Teaching Programming","Z. -A. Tareq; R. J. Raja Yusof","Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",IEEE Transactions on Education,"9 Apr 2024","2024","67","2","282","291","Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3354425","Universiti Malaya and the Erasmus Grant(grant numbers:RU009-2017M,IF024-2018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10436103","Active learning;approach model;computational thinking (CT);computer science;computing skills;game-based learning (GBL);problem-based learning (PBL);problem-solving instructional methods;sorting algorithm;syntax-based learning (SBL)","Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Sorting;Computational modeling;Conferences;Software algorithms","","","","55","IEEE","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3442612","Project KEGA titled by The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Teaching of School Informatics in Secondary Schools(grant numbers:010UPJŠ-4/2024); Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic titled by Proposal of Novel Methods in the Field of Formal Concept Analysis and their Application(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0645/22); Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-20-0069); Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA)(grant numbers:VEGA 2/0097/20); Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure (OPII) through “InoCHF—Research and Development in the Field of Innovative Technologies in the Management of Patients with CHF,” co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:313011BWH2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10669100","Attribute implications;formal concept analysis;light-bot;visualization","Games;Formal concept analysis;Education;Lighting;Programming profession;Lattices;Robots","","","","43","IEEE","6 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To do this, two concepts are explored. The first, ‘serendipity engineering for seductive hypermedia,’ looks at how to design information systems to account for the pleasant occurrences that happen in offline environments studied by those in sales and marketing where beneficial outcomes often occur by chance encounters. The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system. The parametric model presented has great applicability for information and communications technology solution providers.","","978-1-6654-5841-2","10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799097","Captology;Ecological cognition framework;Seductive hypermedia;Serendipity engineering;Socialnomics;User analysis","Scientific computing;Biological system modeling;Digital transformation;Probability;Mathematical models;Cognition;Parametric statistics","","3","","13","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
