The comparison scenario was the teaching of programming logic for higher education students of the Physics course. The research was outlined with the methodology of action research, allowing the evaluation of the use of language at the end of the approach of each content delivered during the research. The presented results refer to the approach of two contents, of the four established for the conclusion of the research. The steps of approaching each content were initiated with the application of the diagnostic evaluation, and finalized with the evaluation of performance. The results indicate a progression in knowledge about programming logic. In this way, it was possible to verify that the use of the Scratch language contributed to the learning of programming logic.","","978-989-98434-8-6","10.23919/CISTI.2018.8399305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8399305","computer education;computational thinking;programming logic;Scratch","Visualization;Programming profession;Education;Tools;Computer languages;Physics","","3","","","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we aim to develop a web-based learning environment for STEAM-blended programming education. The proposed system can provide the learning materials of JavaScript that can easily carry out STEAM education at educational institutions. To effectively realize STEAM-blended programming education, visual programming is useful. Therefore, first, we will examine the learning effectiveness of visual programming. Next, we will develop a web-based programming learning support system based on ""Mathematics"" learning with JavaScript. After the above, the concept of STEAM-blended learning material using LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is shown.","","978-1-7281-2627-2","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2019.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8992619","Computational thinking, STEAM, visual programing, mathematics, JavaScript, Blockly","","","2","","6","IEEE","14 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose YouTube aware personalized recommender system for future ICT education. It is a technique to automatically rank high - visibility channels and videos in YouTube based on the personalized learning topic. To do this, we analyze the relevance of statistics such as views, likes, subscribers, and comments in YouTube, and use the R programming language with the rvest, ggplot2, stringr packages and the Chrome extension called SelectorGadget for direct data crawling.

The reactive nature of this approach means that systems just react to what they are currently sensing, they do not need to have a perfect model of the world, and they can easily respond to external changes in the world. This resilience makes behavior-based systems perfect for real world robotics use. When developers chose this approach for Kodu, the hope was that this resilience would help minimize the potential frustration of young users. This paper introduces the Kodu developers' strategy, results and future plans in developing a user-friendly programming environment that successfully introduces children in a fun and easy way to the fundamental concepts of computer science and computational thinking.","","978-1-4673-8367-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7368999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7368999","Kodu;rule-based formalism;computational thinking","Robot sensing systems;Programming;Graphical user interfaces;Games;Programming environments","","1","","14","IEEE","4 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in educational settings, children are exposed to computational thinking by making games, building scientific simulations and creating stories. Early educational programming languages such as Logo have made programming substantially more accessible to end users. More recent approaches include visual programming with drag-and-drop style of programming making it nearly impossible to compose syntactically incorrect programs. However, as the syntactic challenges of end-user programming are gradually fading into the past, the new frontier of semantic programming support emerges. This demonstration introduces Future Trace, a system to make programming more conversational. A conversational programming agent runs programs one step into the future in order to visualize discrepancies between the programs users intended to write and the actual programs.","1943-6106","978-1-4577-1247-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2011.6070423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6070423","Game design;computational thinking;debugging;end-user programming;visual programming","Programming profession;Games;Debugging;Programming environments;Visualization;Educational institutions","","1","","3","IEEE","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
