"Using App inventor & history as a gateway to engage African American students in computer science","Y. Jimenez; C.

While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.","","978-1-5090-0151-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296512","App Inventor;Broadening Participation;African American Student;computational thinking","History;Mobile applications;Education;Programming profession;Information science;Computer science education;Surveys","","2","","","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation results in tracking a straight line and a circular path are demonstrated respectively.

These projects provide hands-on experiences that may encourage students to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics. Engaging students in real-world problems can help them develop critical thinking skills and generate innovative ideas. STEAM projects can also spark students' curiosity and creativity. This paper will explore developing and implementing a STEAM lesson to introduce students to the engineering and design process and computational thinking. Moreover, this project also addresses a major environmental concern currently in New Jersey, specifically the destruction of the environment by the spotted lanternfly. Therefore, students are also applying skills in civil duty and environmental awareness as a part of their design and plan to eradicate this invasive species.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-5280-1","10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664730","Coding;Computational Thinking;Engineering and Design Process;Environmental Awareness;K-12 Computer Science Education;Problem-Solving;Programming;Real-world Problems;Robotics;Spotted Lanternfly.

If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.","1847-358X","978-953-290-109-2","10.23919/SoftCOM52868.2021.9559050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9559050","coding tools;preschool;school;programming;computational thinking","Training;Fluids;Tools;Encoding;Software;Computer networks;Telecommunications","","","","21","","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model directly influences on the problem solving thought process. The paper further presents a case study on application of this model and its effectiveness validated through the embedded design method. The method appears to be effective in from model analysis and feedback collected.

We research possible deterministic postures in the students' positions that could impede their ethical analysis of the social and environmental effects of the advance of data capitalism, among which racialization, algorithmic sexualization, and discrimination, as well as the erosion of the Commons on the Internet, stand out. The theoretical approach comes from a decolonial ethical framework, and the methodology of this study is qualitative. It consists of, in the first phase of the implementation, two focus groups with engineering students between the ages of 19 and 22 from different semesters and genders. In a second phase, we include eight in-depth interviews with professors from the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities who teach disciplinary and general education subjects in two campuses of a private university in Mexico.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657297","Ethics;critical thinking;decoloniality;data capitalism;educational innovation;higher education;professional education","Seminars;Ethics;Pandemics;Conferences;Sociology;Reflection;Data models","","1","","20","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Teamwork plus technology cuts development time","T. S. Perry",NA,IEEE Spectrum,"6 Aug 2002","1990","27","10","61","67","The deleterious effects of not bringing projects quickly from the laboratory to the market are described, and corporate efforts to cut development time are examined. Many Japanese companies have already wrestled with this problem and moved on to other issues, like their need for basic research. As a result, many US corporations are looking to the Japanese for guidance. This is leading companies to restructure their organizations to encourage open, frequent, and early communication. Launching research projects with technology transfer in view from the start is another approach modeled after the Japanese. Central to Japanese technology transfer is the fact that as a project moves from laboratory to market, the engineers move with it. This is also being tried by some US firms. A less widespread approach to shortening time to market is called concurrent engineering, in which an item is designed concurrently with the processes that would be used to assemble it, manufacture its parts, test it, and repair it in the field. Standardization is also being used to boost researchers' output.<>","1939-9340","","10.1109/6.58479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=58479","","Teamwork;Manufacturing;Research and development;Laboratories;Marketing and sales;Consumer electronics;Hardware;Application software;Production facilities;Computational modeling","","22","","","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In light of this, this paper focuses on the collection and preprocessing of textual data in the power sector and proposes a method for constructing multi-scale fine-tuning samples in the power sector based on the chain of thought. By introducing multi-scale analysis methods, power system data is divided according to different temporal and spatial scales, thereby creating a sample set with hierarchical structure and diversity. This method can adaptively adjust the selection and enhancement strategies of samples based on the characteristics of data at different scales, thus effectively representing and modeling the complex data of the power system and improving the efficiency and accuracy of text data processing in the power sector.","","979-8-3503-5632-8","10.1109/ICNC-FSKD64080.2024.10702203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702203","Textual Dataset Construction;Small Sample Data Augmentation;Chain of Thought","Adaptation models;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Data collection;Knowledge discovery;Data models;Power systems;Computational efficiency;Dispersion;Fuzzy systems","","","","9","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
