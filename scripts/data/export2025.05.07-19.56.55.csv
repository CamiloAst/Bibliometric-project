In this paper, the experience of using block-based programming environments such as Scratch, Lightbot and the PSelnt pseudo-code tool for the understanding of computational concepts and development of computational thinking skills is reported. A quasi-experimental methodological design was used, since it did not work with a control group. A mixed exploratory investigation was carried out. 85 first-year students from the Accounting Professional School of the National University of San Agustin de Arequipa participated in the experience. The results show that in introductory programming courses of short time period, teaching with block-based programming environments compared to the use of pseudocode with the PSelnt tool, facilitates the appropriation of computational concepts and the development of computational thinking skills; thus obtaining better learning results. It is concluded that block-based programming environments favor the construction of knowledge and foster the development of creativity and algorithmic thinking.","","978-1-6654-2358-8","10.1109/LACLO54177.2021.00070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725213","algorithmic thinking;computational thinking;constructionism;digital literacy;problem solving","Design methodology;Education;Programming profession;Creativity;Programming environments","","1","","0","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As such, an increasing number of bachelor's and master's programs outside of the CS discipline integrate CT courses within their study program. At the same time, tools such as notebooks and interactive apps designed to support the teaching of programming concepts are becoming ever more popular. However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics. Our findings suggest that, in the process of learning CT for non-CS students, engagement in active learning activities can be a stronger determinant of learning outcomes than initial knowledge. Furthermore, gamifying computational notebooks can serve as a strong driver of active learning engagement, even more so than initial motivational factors.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3180588","Swissuniversities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9790858","Active learning;computational notebooks;computational thinking (CT);fieldwork learning;gamification;motivation","Education;Hybrid learning;Codes;Programming profession;Encoding;Python;Games","","13","","72","CCBY","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A quasi-experimental research design was employed, involving two fifth-grade classes from a primary school in K city. The study employed methods such as analysis of student works, SPSS scale data analysis, and student interviews to investigate the impact of gamified teaching in Scratch courses on developing elementary students' computational thinking. The results indicate that gamified teaching in Scratch courses significantly enhances the computational thinking level of elementary students, particularly in the dimensions of critical thinking, problem-solving ability, and algorithmic thinking. Based on the research findings, it is recommended that gamified teaching in Scratch courses should involve appropriate teaching tools, incorporate game-based learning, emphasize problem-solving, encourage collaborative learning, and provide training for educators competent in programming education.","","979-8-3503-7266-3","10.1109/ICEIT61397.2024.10541025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10541025","scratch;gamification;elementary students;computational thinking;empirical study","Training;Visualization;Federated learning;Education;Urban areas;Software;Problem-solving","","1","","12","IEEE","5 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning to program is a complex process that requires students to write grammar and instructions. The structure of a programming language does not cause impose problems to students, the real obstacle is how to apply these learned grammars and present them in a complete and correct program code for problem solving. In this study, a deep learning recommendation system was developed, which includes augmented reality (AR) technology, and learning theory, and is provided for study by students in non-major and also from different learning backgrounds. Those students divided into two groups, the students participating in the experimental group were using the AR system with deep learning recommendation and the students participating in the control group were using the AR system without deep learning recommendation. The results show that students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to learning achievement. On the other hand, in the part of computational thinking ability, students using a deep learning recommendation based AR system is significantly better than those using non-deep learning recommendation based AR system. Among the various dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills are significantly different among the two groups of students. The students in experimental group perform better than the control group with regards to the dimensions of computational thinking, creativity, logical computing, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2977679","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 108-2511-H-143-002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020189","Deep learning recommendation;computational thinking;AR technology","Machine learning;Education;Programming profession;Problem-solving;Grammar;Augmented reality","","77","","59","CCBY","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises. This paper presents the joint research between the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC) and the PRONIE MEP-FOD program of the Omar Dengo Foundation. Its objective is to automatically analyze the source code created by the students, evaluate the Computational Thinking skills they developed and compare the results with the learning objectives established in the study plans.","","978-1-6654-5841-2","10.1109/CSCI54926.2021.00222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9799068","Computation thinking;program analysis;automatic grading","Measurement;Codes;Scientific computing;Education;Software;Planning;Pattern recognition","","2","","31","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
