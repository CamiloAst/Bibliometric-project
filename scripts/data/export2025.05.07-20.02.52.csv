"Teaching first-year interdisciplinary students to use computational design software in a spatial thinking course","B. Ben Youssef; B. Berry; M.

Further, students' spatial abilities are an important prerequisite to technological literacy within virtual environments. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities teaching a large group of first-year, interdisciplinary students to apply spatial thinking skills by undertaking a team-based, design project using an industrial-strength computational design environment (SolidWorks). We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being “lost” in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks.","","978-1-4673-0840-3","10.1109/IEDEC.2012.6186914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6186914","Spatial thinking;first-year students;3D modeling;computational design software;SolidWorks;small group projects;instructional principles;scaffolding techniques;cognitive load","Assembly;Tutorials;Software;Three dimensional displays;Education;Computational modeling","","","","32","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Instilling Computational Thinking in Undergraduate Students Across Multiple Disciplines through an Adaptive Gamified e-Learning Platform","A. K. Ng; I. Atmosukarto; J. K. Lee Teo; A. B. Amran","Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore; Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore; Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore; Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore","2023 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering (TALE)","26 Jan 2024","2023","","","1","7","This full paper presents the instillation of computational thinking (CT) in undergraduate students across multiple disciplines through an adaptive gamified e-learning platform. In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.","","978-1-6654-5331-8","10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398325","computational thinking;adaptive learning;gamification;independent learning;online education;multiple disciplines","Surveys;Computer languages;Electronic learning;Education;Sociology;Games;Problem-solving","","","","30","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962398","Computational thinking;engineering students;electronic spreadsheets for learning;physics courses in engineering;professional skills","Knowledge engineering;Engineering profession;Solids;Mathematical models;Cognition;Software;Engineering students","","2","","27","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the cross-lagged relations between the two were unknown. This study investigated the cross-lagged association between CT cognitive performance and attitudinal beliefs of primary students through a three-wave longitudinal design. The paper reported the first two waves of data collection, with an 8-month time interval, involving a sample of 392 students (age 9-11). At each wave, students were asked to complete a CT cognitive test and a self-reported attitude survey. Through cross-lagged analyses, the results showed that prior CT cognitive performance significantly predicted later learning attitudes, and the paths remained significant after controlling for students’ demographics and learning experiences. The study contributes to the literature by pioneering documenting the cross-lagged relations between students’ cognitive and attitudinal attainments in the context of CT education.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-9117-4","10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148553","computational thinking;coding attitudes;longitudinal study;cross-lagged panel model","Surveys;Attitude control;Computational modeling;Education;Data collection","","1","","27","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This course was based on materials developed from a previous program that trained high school teachers in computational thinking and programming through LSU's Cain Center. Pedagogical content knowledge informed the design of this course. Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch. The transition from the CS curriculum taught in high schools to what follows in college needs to be smoother.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272455","computational thinking;computer science teachers;Research Practitioner Partnership","Programming profession;Computational modeling;Training;STEM;Encoding;Planning;Interviews","","1","","3","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
