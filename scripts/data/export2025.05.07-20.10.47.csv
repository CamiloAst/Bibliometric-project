Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.","","978-1-7281-4849-6","10.1109/BB48857.2019.8941222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8941222","block-based programming;game-based learning;K-12 computer science education;computational thinking","Games;Programming profession;Engines;Three-dimensional displays;Education","","7","","21","IEEE","27 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the CKE framework, we develop a creativity technique called InnoSpider which greatly support human's perception, intuition, reasoning and cognition for quick decision making.

In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3402991","Piensa ComputacionULLmente, Educational Program for the Promotion of Computational Thinking through the Realization of Activities that Allow its Development and its Inclusion in the Curriculum(grant numbers:23120270); Cabildo Insular de Tenerife; Fundación General de la Universidad de La Laguna; C**4, Computational Thinking in the Canarian Educational System: Diagnosis and Roadmap for its Integration into the Curriculum; Convocatoria Proyectos Investigación 2020, Fundación LaCaixa-CajaCanarias(grant numbers:2020EDU01); Canary Islands Agency for Research, Innovation and the Information Society of the Ministry of Universities, Science, Innovation and Culture; European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) Integrated Operational Program of the Canary Islands 2021–2027, Axis 3, Priority 74 (85%); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10534769","Computer science;computational thinking;primary education;secondary education;gender studies","Education;Programming profession;Training;Phase measurement;Sorting;Shape;Instruments","","","","41","CCBY","20 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578653","Computational thinking;Mathematics;Early childhood education;STEM;STEAM","Systematics;Reviews;Knowledge acquisition;Solids;Data processing;Mathematics;Engineering education","","1","","52","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900775","human-robot interaction;mutual understanding;collaborative learning;computational thinking","Learning systems;Costs;Correlation;Federated learning;Collaboration;Humanoid robots;Behavioral sciences","","","","21","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track. The aim of this work is to test if using a hybrid approach for teaching K-12 students programming by combining both software and hardware techniques is more effective than using a singleton approach.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-9506-7","10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725223","","Programming profession;Games;Sensors;Education;Software;Hardware","","1","","12","IEEE","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
