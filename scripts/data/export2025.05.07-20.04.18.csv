In this study we propose the conceptual model of Cooperative Thinking, a new education construct of team-based computational problem solving. Cooperative Thinking is not only the sum of Computational Thinking and Agile Values, rather it is a new overarching competence suitable to deal with complex software engineering problems. We suggest to tackle the Cooperative Thinking construct as an education goal, to train new generations of software developers to Pareto-optimize both their individual and teaming performances.","2574-1934","978-1-4503-5663-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449478","Computational Thinking;Agile values;Cooperative Thinking","Software;Software engineering;Computational modeling;Education;Problem-solving;Computer science;Task analysis","","","","13","","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2023.3334193","Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María(grant numbers:PI_L_17_12); Centro Nacional de Inteligencia Artificial (CENIA), BASAL, Agencia Nacional de Investigación y Desarrollo (ANID)(grant numbers:FB210017); Millenium Nucleus Futures of AI and its socio-cultural implications in Chile and Latin America, FAIR, ANID(grant numbers:NCS2022_065); Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM) Project(grant numbers:OEA22202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10345555","Computational thinking;engineering education;gender;Latin America;public/private schools","Programming profession;Training;Education;Conferences;Public policy;Engineering students;Codes","","1","","56","CCBY","5 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Understanding the Source of Confusion with Computational Thinking: A Systematic Review of Definitions","F. Xu; S.

However, the lack of a consensual definition of CT and the confusion with other similar terms made it a big challenge for researchers and practitioners to understand this concept. The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-1383-1","10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764144","Computational Thinking;Algorithmic Thinking;Educational Curriculum;Operational Definition;Systematic review","Computer science;Systematics;Conferences;Education;Prototypes;Pragmatics","","2","","33","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342946","Gamification;Educational Software;Learning Technology;Computational Thinking;Systematic Thinking","Learning systems;Heart;Systematics;Games;Virtual reality;Cognition;Teamwork","","","","15","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.","","978-1-7281-5434-3","10.1109/SVR.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8921049","Computational Thinking;Augmented Reality;Technology in Education","Augmented reality;Education;Target tracking;Programming profession;Rendering (computer graphics);Androids","","5","","10","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is particularly true for black communities. Applications for physiological computing include systems such as wearable technology (e.g., Apple Watch) capable of mapping students' physiological activity to various outputs. The work discussed in this paper presents our initial steps toward filling these gaps. In particular, we share our observations of computational thinking perspectives that emerged while black high school students constructed simple programs driven by near real-time brain wave information.
