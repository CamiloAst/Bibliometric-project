In this paper, we use an example of throwing the ball into the basket to make the robots process with human-like thinking behavior. Such thinking behavior adopted in this paper is divided into two modes: fast and slow. The fast mode belongs to the intuitional reaction, and the slow mode represents the complicated cogitation in human brain. This fascinating human thinking concept is inspired by the book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, which explains the process of the human brain. In addition, the psychology theories proposed in this book are also adopted to realize the thinking algorithms, and our experiments verify that the thinking mode of human beings is reasonable and effective in robots.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2601167","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 103-2221-E-006-252,MOST 104-2221-E-006-228-MY2); Ministry of Education, Taiwan, within the Aim for the Top University Project through National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546844","Anchoring effect;fast and slow systems;FIRA;humanoid robot;learning algorithm;peak-end rule;psychology","Robots;Human factors;Psychology;Cognition;Humanoid robots;Learning systems;Cognition","","6","","50","OAPA","17 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Adapting Computational Skills for AI Integration","H. Elhashemy; H. Abelson; T.

However, software engineering education has not adequately addressed integrating comprehensive data science curricula, leaving students ill-equipped for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), which is built on the foundations of data science. This gap is exacerbated by the lack of tailored courses and the intimidating nature of existing tools for begin-ners. Consequently, students often miss out on essential skills like data cleanup, real-world application of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the integration of big data in software products. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach to applied data science for software engineering students. We argue for a shift from traditional algorithm-focused teaching to a curriculum emphasizing real-world problem-solving, lever-aging data science techniques. By empowering students to define and tackle their own data-driven projects, we aim to increase motivation, enhance data literacy, and instill a data-thinking mindset in future software engineers to prepare them for the AI world. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of software engineering education for young learners by offering a comprehensive framework, the data action educational framework (DAEF), and a data science toolkit that enables DAEF by empowering learners to create original data-driven mobile apps.","2377-570X","979-8-3503-7897-9","10.1109/CSEET62301.2024.10663020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10663020","data thinking;data science;software engineering education;computational action","Machine learning algorithms;Education;Software algorithms;Machine learning;Data science;Software;Mobile applications","","","","18","IEEE","10 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By comparing two educational frameworks—the CAS framework, developed from computational thinking research and CAS research papers, and the InterPARES framework, based on empirical studies with archivists working with AI/ML, we identify areas of alignment and divergence. While both frameworks share significant concordance, suggesting a growing consensus on integrating computing into archival work, key differences in their approaches (learning outcomes vs. competencies) and focus areas (such as work practices, systems thinking, and cybersecurity) highlight the need for further discourse among archival scholars, educators, and practitioners. These distinctions must be addressed before formalizing CAS educational frameworks. This paper also initiates efforts to integrate emerging technological competencies by bridging the CAS and InterPARES frameworks, emphasizing the value of complementary perspectives from both professional practice and academic research. We argue that such integration is essential for developing robust competency frameworks in archival education, particularly within higher education's professional programs.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825962","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10825962","computational archival science;education;educational frameworks;archives;artificial intelligence","Training;Big Data;Systems thinking;Computer security","","","","21","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups. These findings suggest that previous knowledge or exposure to different practices can result in different progressions of more complex computational practices, emphasizing the relevance of troubleshooting and debugging as a practice required for a successful and timely progression on the acquisition of other computational thinking practices.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061277","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:EEC #1826099,EEC #1449238); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360590","Engineering education;engineering students;pattern analysis;statistical learning","Computational modeling;Problem-solving;Data models;Taxonomy;Programming profession;Tools;Mathematical model","","12","","31","CCBY","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Computational Thinking Curriculum for Unmanned Aerial Systems","S. Zhang; C. Stewart",The Ohio State University; The Ohio State University,2019 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON),"9 Apr 2020","2019","","","122","125","Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can explore common, vast and unsafe places at low cost. They could transform multiple sectors from photography to farming to city planning. However, the software underlying UAS is complex and requires multiple distinct programming skills, e.g., AI, machine learning and flight control. Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings. UAV topics and computational thinking depth link lessons. Teachers can trade breadth for in-depth coding and vice versa. In early work, we presented an autonomous UAS to middle school students. Our 1 hour workshop focused on breadth and was received well.","2379-2027","978-1-7281-1416-3","10.1109/NAECON46414.2019.9057865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9057865","","Software;Conferences;Artificial intelligence;Drones;Face;Password;FAA","","1","","17","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
