The teaching organization starts from application scenarios, and combines database theoretical knowledge with the process from analysis, modeling to establishing database application. Using this method to organize teaching, the students learn to know the how and the why, not only to understand what database is, but also understand and grasp how to use, how to better use of database, thus their ability on analyzing and solving concrete problem is improved.","","978-1-4673-2406-9","10.1109/ICCIS.2012.310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6300734","database design;teaching mainlin;Computational Thinking","Databases;Data models;Educational institutions;Business;Analytical models;Design methodology","","1","","3","IEEE","13 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is expected that these entities of IoE will communicate to one another, and produce a huge amount of invaluable data, thus generating a need to understand this kind of data. Computational approaches have shown their capabilities in extracting valuable information from such data. Usually these techniques focus on determining concrete concepts (particular activities such as driving, sitting, or entities like digit `1', `2' etc.). On the contrary, abstract concept identification (actions such as Motion-state, Static-state, or entity like `Number') is relatively less explored. In this article we present a methodology to model abstract representation of concepts without supervision, along with a mechanism to utilize generated models in an artificial system. Primarily, we illustrate a Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) approach that identifies abstract concepts, and dynamically builds a hierarchy to represent them. Further, we describe RANs learning, a novel way of associating concepts in two subsequent layers. We experimentally demonstrate how our approach is unsupervised, and able to model abstract activity (static-state and motion-state) of the subjects, using the Smart-phones Dataset from UCI machine learning repository for Human Activity Recognition problem.","2472-8489","978-1-5386-5346-3","10.1109/CONTROLO.2018.8514540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514540","Unsupervised Machine Learning;Artificial Systems;Context Modeling;Computational Cognitive Modeling","Computational modeling;Data models;Legged locomotion;Internet of Things;Activity recognition;Context modeling;Mathematical model","","4","2","19","EU","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The career/development layer is for development in four major areas: Application (applying knowledge), Research (advancing knowledge), Entrepreneurship (innovating/realizing knowledge) and Service (serving with knowledge).

Digital social grouping is now a common practice for exchanging any kind of data between group connections. However, this has posed some key issues for education professionals on the best path to the current educational system to fully embrace this practice and move on. [1] It suggests that “the school model as we know it is over. It makes no sense to students, does not produce expected results, nor prepares the new generations for the challenges of contemporary life.” To fill this gap, an innovative teaching model emerged as an alternative approach centered on the student and reinforced by the pedagogical and technological infrastructures. This work presents a framework as a computational tool to build and provide custom educational interfaces based on the concept of persuasion to push users to the most relevant content (eg, direction). This structure is based on participatory elements from various disciplines that cross the fields of education, computational engineering and psychology. The proposed framework shows that user interactions explored from the persuasion, engagement, and content customization techniques take into account the skills, needs and interests make teaching more attractive and applicable.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658681","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658681","Innovative teaching model;Persuasive Interfaces;Educational Computational Strategies","Education;Psychology;Tools;Computational modeling;Prototypes;Human computer interaction;Adaptation models","","1","","38","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance—and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT. Our results demonstrate differential patterns of resting-state connectivity associated with individual creative thinking ability, extending past work using a new application to automatically assess creativity via semantic distance.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_01658","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01AG061083, R01AG061811); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DRL-1920653); John Templeton Foundation(grant numbers:RFP-15-12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345570","","","","","","","Traditional","2 Feb 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"
