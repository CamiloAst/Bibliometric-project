Influenced by the social constructivist paradigm, modern teaching promotes collaborative learning and peer assessment as two effective active learning strategies to which technologies are becoming increasingly important assistance. This paper presents three cases in which various technologies were deployed in some undergraduate biology courses to maximize students' active learning opportunities.","2155-1812","978-1-4244-6370-1","10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5529487","active learning;collaborative;peer assessment;pedagogy;clickers;biology","Educational technology;Collaborative work;Computer science education;Modems;Biology computing;Peer to peer computing;Computational biology;International collaboration;Electronic mail;Biological system modeling","","","","30","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The cognitive revolution and its implications for creating knowledge tools needed in achieving a sustainable society","J. L. Miller","KnowledgeNet, Toronto, ONT, Canada",Proceedings 1995 Interdisciplinary Conference: Knowledge Tools for a Sustainable Civilization. Fourth Canadian Conference on Foundations and Applications of General Science Theory,"6 Aug 2002","1995","","","235","244","The last 30 years have witnessed a qualitative change in our conception of how people learn (usually called the ""cognitive revolution""), so that we think today not only in terms of acquiring discrete facts and skills but also in far more powerful terms of acquiring new ways of thinking. Of particular importance is the process of acquiring the habits of systematic and disciplined inquiry characteristic of organized science. To the social theorist and policy maker, however, the existence of a new, more powerful view of learning is a mixed blessing. Decisions of how best to implement the lessons of the cognitive revolution require technocratic know-how as well as social and political judgment. I discuss the cognitive revolution by offering a comparison of two contrasting views of education that it has produced, which I call ""institution-centred"" and ""person-centred"" methodologies. In terms of their pedagogical effectiveness, both methodologies have been shown to be successful, when implemented in a congenial social environment by competent professionals. The essential difference is political. An institution-centered methodology has as side-effect to encourage a greater sense of commitment, loyalty and perhaps even dependence in regard to teachers, educational and social institutions and authority figures in general; in contrast, a person-centered methodology encourages a greater sense of autonomy and self-reliance. Cognitive methods can be useful for policy makers with a wide range of priorities and commitments, if correctly chosen.","","0-7803-3365-9","10.1109/KTSC.1995.569179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569179","","Psychology;Cognitive science;Production;Educational institutions;Animals","","","","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.","2470-6698","978-1-5386-6522-0","10.1109/TALE.2018.8615288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8615288","immersive learning;finite state machine;computer science unplugged;computational thinking;theoretical computer science","Automata;Games;Computer science;Education;Visualization;Boats;Virtual reality","","10","","34","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural ""somatic logic"" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2006.889200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4203030","Biomechanical models;complexity;hand;manipulation;model-structure detection;nonlinear systems","Tendons;Fingers;Computer networks;Logic;Information processing;Neuromuscular;Torque;Production;Process control;Control systems","Cadaver;Computational Biology;Computer Simulation;Finger Joint;Finger Joint;Fingers;Humans;Models, Anatomic;Models, Biological;Muscle, Skeletal;Muscle, Skeletal;Stress, Mechanical;Tendons;Torque","92","","28","IEEE","21 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637257","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19K02985); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637257","programming education;teaching material;assessment tool;Computational Thinking;elementary school","Visualization;Education;Tactile sensors;Light emitting diodes;Encoding;Sensors;Servomotors","","","","23","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
