Although widely used in K12 education, many articles indicate a lack of uniformity in the conceptualization of CT. CT is defined as the systematic problem-solving ability based on algorithmic processes. It is seen as crucial for stimulating interest and diversity in STEM careers. Effective CT teaching requires precise conceptualization and appropriate teaching techniques. With the world's increasing digitization, CT is considered as fundamental as reading or math skills and should be taught from K12 education. This article reports a systematic mapping of CT con-cepts applied in K12 activities, reflecting on the chosen activities and teaching techniques. Despite some articles highlighting the unclear definition of CT, there is a notable agreement on its key concepts. The study used the IEEEXplore database, analyzing primary articles from 2019–2023. The findings reveal a high degree of similarity in CT concepts, indicating a trend towards standardization. A catalog of frequently cited activities used to teach CT is presented, aiding teachers in introducing CT in their classes. This study supports the development of teaching policies and initiatives. contributing to STEM interest and diversity.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892901","Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil(grant numbers:001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10892901","computational thinking;computational thinking concepts;K12;STEM education;STEM;STEAM","Systematics;Engineering profession;Databases;Education;Standardization;Market research;Problem-solving","","","","53","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study contributes to the growing body of research on computation in engineering education by introducing computational concepts and activities during a physics laboratory class. Drawing from Experiential Learning Theory and using an adapted version of the Use-Modify-Create framework for teaching computational thinking, a series of lab activities was designed that combined physical lab experiments with computational modeling using custom-built VPython simulations. Data was collected from the labs in the form of (1) responses to lab activity worksheets, (2) code modified and/or generated by the students during lab activities, (3) in-code comments provided by the students during the activities. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze students' learning benefits and any challenges faced during the activities. While results show a number of learning benefits, an observed homogeneity of student responses to the questions on the lab handouts point to a set of potential limitations within the activities themselves that warranted further examination. Insight gained from this analysis process is presented as a set of four design principles that will inform future implementations of the hybrid course design.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028390","computational thinking;engineering education;physics education;computational modeling;design-based research","Physics;Computational modeling;Education;Programming;Software;Atmospheric modeling;Context modeling","","4","","33","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
