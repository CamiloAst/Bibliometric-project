This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.","2166-0549","978-1-7281-9171-3","10.1109/EITT50754.2020.00049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320665","Computational thinking;Programming education;Instructional procedure;Instructional strategy","Programming profession;Education;Interviews;Problem-solving;Tools;Task analysis;Focusing","","1","","35","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.","","978-1-7281-3470-3","10.1109/e-Engineering47629.2021.9470593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470593","assessment;computational thinking;introductory programming;psychometric properties","Instruments;Education;Programming;Reliability theory;Tools;Data structures;Pattern recognition","","1","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. This course will look at the synergies that are required across the stack from new devices to new computational models for designing future computing systems. This course will enable attendees to understand the inter-twined nature of design optimization that requires one to interact with experts in different domains. The students will be exposed to simulation tools and modelling techniques to help explore new circuits and architectures. As physical dimensional scaling alone has ceased to be the key factor driving the industry, many innovations have occurred in designing new types of logic switches including changes to their structure (such as three-dimensional FinFETs), their underlying physics (use of tunneling for steep-switching devices), the material systems (integration of ferro-electrics in gate stack for Negative Capacitance FETs). The first part of the lecture will introduce these devices, simulation models and accompanying circuit innovations. There has been a world of revolution in the memory devices with the emergence of many nonvolatile memory technologies and their tight integration in cross-point architectures. These memory systems have enabled new styles of computing systems such as the non-volatile processor for internet of thing systems and neuromorphic computing systems for cognitive computing. The lectures will focus on the synergistic coordination in advances in devices to system design. Neuromorphic systems also leverage new advances in technology such as cross-point memory arrays to integrate computing and store. Another emerging novel computational model is based on the principle “let physics do the computation”. This technique focuses on using the intrinsic operation mechanism of devices (such as nanoscale electronic coupled oscillators) to do the computation, instead of building complex circuits with standard transistors to carry out the same function. The primary objective is to train the next generation researchers and practitioners that can understand the synergy across the stack from devices to applications. This will prepare the next generation workforce for the beyond Moore era using post-CMOS devices and new computational paradigms beyond Von-Neumann computing models. This course will introduce the following topics: [1] Emerging logic and memory devices: What value do they add for circuit designers/architects? [2] Circuit/Architecture design using Emerging Logic and Memory devices [3] Neuromorphic and Brain-Inspired Computing using emerging devices [4] Computing Using Coupled Dynamical Systems.","2380-6923","978-1-5386-3692-3","10.1109/VLSID.2018.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326881","","Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Computer architecture;Neuromorphics;Nanoscale devices;Electrical engineering","","","","","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.","","978-1-4244-2738-3","10.1109/UWBUS.2008.4669406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669406","logic;time-dependent electromagnetic field;exact mathematical model;computation","Mathematics;Electromagnetic fields;Logic;Distributed computing;Partial differential equations;Mathematical model;Current distribution;Computational modeling;Electromagnetic modeling;Boundary conditions","","","","5","IEEE","7 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272487","inquiry-based learning;computer science;computational thinking;multilingual;English learners","Computer science;Education;Standards;Linguistics;Statistics;Sociology;Interviews","","9","","42","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
