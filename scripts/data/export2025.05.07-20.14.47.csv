Entitled “CT Pathways” for short, the three-year research practitioner partnership (RPP) is a collaboration between Digital Promise Global, Digital Promise, and the League of Innovative Schools, a national network of 101 school districts across 33 states, serving over 3 million students. The goal of CT Pathways is to design, investigate and improve inclusive computing pathways for all K-12 students, starting in elementary school and going through high school. In this RPP, researchers join with three “Core” districts and twelve “Pilot” districts from the League of Innovative Schools to focus on districts’ Hispanic and African American students, Title 1 schools and, more generally, their girls and low-income students. The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads. At this early stage, the primary goal is to help districts align the economic and digital literacy rationales for CS/CT education with the wider social justice and broadening participation considerations they have identified.","","978-1-7281-0821-6","10.1109/RESPECT46404.2019.8985843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985843","computational thinking;CSforAll;equity;computer science pathways","Education;Computer science;Collaboration;Proposals;Engineering computing;Economics","","","","","IEEE","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The word computation has received increased attention in today's world because of its applicability in all fields. This tool is very helpful for the user who doesn't have prior programming knowledge and they want to learn and apply the computational concepts as part of their design process. `Building-Blocks' is a graphical programming language used for generation of 3D structures using computational algorithms. This helps to create personally meaningful projects: designing a model, getting the physical object from a model, sharing ideas and project activities with others in Building-Blocks community.","","978-1-5386-4430-0","10.1109/ICCCNT.2018.8494036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8494036","K-12 education;computational thinking;3D model","Three-dimensional displays;Shape;Computational modeling;Education;Graphical user interfaces;Buildings;Visualization","","","","21","IEEE","18 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT shows excellent conversational and creative reasoning capabilities. However, we still know very little about the design ideation process and its performance in terms of productivity. In this paper, we propose a representation of the design ideation process based on NLP. On this basis, referring to LASSO and linkography method, we propose a DCLASSO model to calculate the interconnections between design moves in protocol analysis. In the subsequent experiment, we take the design protocols generated by ChatGPT as the experimental sample to verify the proposed model. Finally, with the generated linkographs, the characteristics of ChatGPT and human designers are analyzed and compared from aspects of design ideation process and design productivity.","2473-3547","979-8-3503-1745-9","10.1109/ISCID59865.2023.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494302","Design productivity;Design ideation;ChatGPT;Linkography","Productivity;Analytical models;Protocols;Computational modeling;Chatbots;Cognition;Creativity","","1","","17","IEEE","15 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Thinking, expertise and diagrams that encode laws","P. C. . -H.

A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described. The domain is that of collisions among bodies moving in a straight line, with no frictional resistance.","","","10.1049/ic:19960052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=646161","","","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Graduate student fellows work with experienced K-12 teachers to create and deploy interactive computational thinking (CT) modules in middle and high school classrooms that promote active learning through the use of technology and cutting edge scientific research. One of the main objectives of the DISSECT program is to facilitate the professional development of graduate students in computing-rich fields, such as engineering, computer science, and biology, through leadership development, public speaking experience, and an enhanced vision of how CT is vital to in all scientific disciplines. The alliances formed between K-12 teachers and their fellows provide an opportunity for teachers to attain knowledge of CT principles and equips them with the ability to develop and continue their own future lesson plans integrating CT. This paper thoroughly describes specific modules that integrate CT concepts into the traditional 6th grade science curriculum, the statistical results of assessments gauging the development of CT skills and knowledge during the course of one academic year, and suggestions for improvements and incorporation into other curricula.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344240","Computational Thinking;K-12;Interdisciplinary;graduate fellows","Fellows;Engineering profession;Geologic measurements;Writing;Geology;Meteorology;Rockets","","6","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2018.8358673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358673","autism spectrum disorders;computational thinking;game design workshop;neurodiversity","Autism;Guidelines;Games;Conferences;IEEE transactions;Organizations;Bibliographies","","3","","","IEEE","14 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
