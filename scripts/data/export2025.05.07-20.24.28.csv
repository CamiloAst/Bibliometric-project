"PREFACE","P. J. Denning; M. Tedre",NA; NA,Computational Thinking,"","2019","","","ix","xv","A computer revolution is in full swing. The invasion of computing into every part of our lives has brought enormous benefits including email, internet, World Wide Web, Amazon's e-commerce, Kahn Academy, Uber's taxi hailing, Google's maps, trip navigators, smartphones, real-time translators, and apps by the millions. At the same time it has also brought enormous concerns including possible loss of jobs to automation, mass surveillance, collapse of critical infrastructure, cyber war, mass sales of personal data, invasions of advertising, loss of privacy, polarization of politics, loss of civility and respectful listening, and exacerbated income inequality.","","9780262353410","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8709355.pdf&bkn=8709327&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","9 May 2019","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

The main structure of the tutorial includes a review of the literature and motivation for conducting a design sprint, the step-by-step process of a traditional design sprint and alternative approaches relevant to research environments. The tutorial will incorporate tools for planning and preparing the research environment and research team, interactive technological tools for collaboration, guided instruction on conducting a data analysis, and research-related challenges and solutions to be considered. We use two examples from the literature including one from our team’s design of a software to facilitate the review of genetic test offerings, and one of others that designed a diabetes patient portal. This tutorial is intended for participants interested in human-centered design and learning how to utilize state-of-the-art tools and resources to apply a modified design sprint methodology in a research setting.","2575-2634","979-8-3503-0263-9","10.1109/ICHI57859.2023.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10337301","design sprint;human-centered design;design thinking;user interface design;user design research","Data analysis;Design methodology;Tutorials;Medical services;Genetics;Software;Planning","","","","7","IEEE","11 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Computational Thinking, a Discipline to Enhance Digital Skills Such as Programming","Y.

The methodological approach used was quantitative, using a quasi-experimental design, taking pretest/posttest measures, with experimental and control groups. The sample of participating students was 46. They belonged to a group of first grade of primary education, aged between 6 and 7 years, in a Spanish educational center. The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group. Therefore, we can statistically attribute the mastery of computational thinking skills to the participation in the training activities.","","978-1-6654-9843-2","10.1109/IESTEC54539.2022.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040862","learning;teaching;education;information;society;computing","Robots;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Programming profession;Asia;Visualization;Training","","","","","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"MiDroid: An open mobile platform for learning focused on microcontrollers' education","J. Á. Ariza","Uniminuto, Dept of electronic technology, Bogotá, Colombia",2017 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"14 Dec 2017","2017","","","1","5","This WIP exposes the design and implementation of Midroid, an open mobile platform focused on microcontrollers' education. The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area. These aspects were needed in the design and implementation of the platform in the areas of hardware and software respectively. It is expected with this research, the design and implementation of a mobile platform related to microcontrollers; area which addresses the problems mentioned and also enhances the learning process in the students. The educational and technical validation of the platform will be developed through qualitative study between different groups of students in the subjects of the curriculum concerning the microcontrollers' area, thus, validating the impact of the platform.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190717","Platform;mobile;computational thinking;microcontrollers;education methodology;algorithmic thinking;programming","Microcontrollers;Software;Hardware;Mobile communication;Algorithm design and analysis;Bluetooth;Pins","","1","","14","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
