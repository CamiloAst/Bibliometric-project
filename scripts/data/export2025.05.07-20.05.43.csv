"A Free-Choice Social Learning Network for Computational Thinking","H.

Alarmingly, research suggests that the relative popularity of computer science in K-12 and colleges is not increasing while other STEM subjects are witnessing substantial rise in enrollment. Moreover, more than one third of those who choose computer science, drop out or fail the first programming class dashing hopes of building a computationally savvy workforce for the emerging global economy. In this paper, we introduce a novel social networking system, called OpenSchool, for learners and educators alike, which is able to double as a contemporary social networking system along the lines of Facebook for instance, and serve the special needs of free-choice STEM learners, computer science learners in particular. We discuss its salient features, highlight its advantages, collaborating capabilities, and learning support for STEM, especially computational thinking, learners.","2161-377X","978-1-5386-6049-2","10.1109/ICALT.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8433456","social learning;computational thinking;social network;STEM;intelligent tutoring systems;free choice learning","Facebook;Programming profession;Tools;Python","","3","","21","IEEE","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current study developed an Online Inquiry-based learning platform for Computational Thinking (CT-ONLINQ) to support CT activities using Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) pedagogy. IBL-based CT steps include algorithm design, analysis, and comparison of algorithms. The platform allows students to explore multiple solutions and provides hints as support during problem-solving activities. A 4-week experimental study was conducted to evaluate the usability of the online platform. A total of 79 9th-grade students volunteered to participate in this study to complete six activities. Subsequently, the students completed the SUS questionnaire and open-ended feedback questions. Results showed that around 80% of the students scored above the “Good” category (70-80), with a total average score of 78.45. Also, we analyzed the difference in rating scores among groups based on multiple background factors. Findings showed an average rating above 4 with no significant difference between the ratings among factors such as gender and math performance (below-above average math scores). In addition, analysis of the feedback comments showed that the platform is user-friendly, with students enthusiastic about learning coding on the platform.","2161-377X","979-8-3503-0054-3","10.1109/ICALT58122.2023.00059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10260900","Computational Thinking;Inquiry-based Learning;Online Platform;Algorithm design;System Usability Scale","Education;Encoding;Problem-solving;Usability","","1","","28","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This situation likely hinders the creation of inclusive and user-friendly systems due to a bias in perspectives. To narrow this gender gap, this study investigates how females program to increase interest in computer sciences. Specifically, 60 open Scratch projects on the web are analyzed to clarify differences in the Computational Thinking scores with respect to gender. The difference in the Computational Thinking score by gender suggests that the gap may be due to the lack of the Synchronization element in female users’ projects. A deeper understanding of how people program based on gender should support creating an effective and inclusive learning environment and allow educators to create programming materials that attract both genders equally into the field.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-9117-4","10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10148435","computational thinking;computer science;gender bias;Scratch;STEM","Industries;Education;Synchronization;Programming profession","","1","","13","IEEE","14 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking skills are closely related to the CS concepts and approaches. These skills cover fundamental programming concepts such as task decomposition, abstractions and generalization, data structures and algorithms. On the other hand, CS education challenges, promote the search for new educational tools, methods, activities and resources. Consequently, CS education should be extended by adding the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) paradigm principles. The aim of this paper is to show how STEM-driven CS education supports and ensures the development of computational thinking at the high school. We present the already published STEM-driven CS education approach aiming at extending it by introducing a model to assess student achievements, according to the revised Bloom's taxonomy in the connection with CT skills. As a practical implementation, we describe a curriculum of Programming Basics at the high school with respect to STEM-driven aspects and CT skills. We introduce two case studies implemented in the real educational environment. They provide the evidence of availability of our approach.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-2957-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2018.8363456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363456","Computational Thinking;STEM;STEM-Driven education;Computer Science education;STEM-driven CS education;Revised Bloom's Taxonomy","Engineering education;Conferences;Three-dimensional displays","","17","","56","IEEE","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current programming education in secondary schools is not as effective as it could be in concrete implementation. Project-based learning is a possible path for programming education, but it is still difficult to achieve the goal of cultivating innovative talents by project-based learning alone. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate design thinking into project-based learning, firstly, we analyze the connotation of design thinking and explain the necessity of integrating design thinking into project-based learning; secondly, we construct a new model and practice process framework of secondary school programming PBL teaching integrating design thinking based on the general process of project-based learning and the basic model of design thinking, and explain the connotation. Finally, a case study of “Python programming” in the new version of high school IT textbook is conducted to provide reference for the practice of secondary school programming education.","","978-1-6654-8188-5","10.1109/CSTE55932.2022.00019","Fundamental Research Funds For the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020TS083); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973148","design thinking;project-based learning;secondary school programming;model construction;curriculum case study","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Education;Reflection;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Python","","","","28","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Educational games have been applied by several researchers to address related issues faced for promoting CT. Even though such games have shown some success in promoting CT, they fall short when it comes to acquisition of CT skills (they rather promote abstract and conceptual knowledge) and offering adaptivity to each player. To address these issues and improve the existing games, we developed an adaptive game called AutoThinking for teaching both CT concepts and skills, engaging students with individually tailored gameplay and learning. We conducted a qualitative study aimed at understanding the cognitive and affective experiences of Estonian primary school children. The findings showed that AutoThinking is making children feel challenged, happy, and confident, while activating their thinking process during the gameplay. All children perceived the game positively and found it to be a good tool for learning.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-6090-0","10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155816","adaptive educational game;computational thinking;primary school children;qualitative study","Games;Education;Programming profession;Syntactics;Computer languages;Interviews","","7","","18","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
