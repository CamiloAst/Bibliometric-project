This has inspired ideas for new lesson plans, instructional strategies, teacher guidance, and, most importantly, new approaches to grading these skills. Aim: This article presents the results of a systematic review initially focused on identifying the various ways of assessing CT in school and their relationship to relevant CT skills. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess CT in schools. This review applied a semi-automatic search for specific terms within the selected papers. These terms came from the analysis of several established definitions of CT. Results: We present a set of the most representative competencies and concepts developed in various experiences, in which the main topic is the assessment of CT, as well as some that have not been developed and that may be the subject of future works. Conclusions: The evaluation of CT in the school requires multiple approaches; it is a challenge to have a single method or strategy to evaluate everything that CT implies.","1932-8540","","10.1109/RITA.2023.3323762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10280127","Computational thinking;assessment;education;STEM","Proposals;Systematics;Programming profession;Reliability;Data mining;Training;Problem-solving;STEM;Education;Computational modeling","","2","","80","IEEE","11 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly ""computational thinking"", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment. Finally, we look at an ongoing after school robotics club where participants face a number of challenges of their own making as they design and create a variety of robots using a number of common tools such as Scratch and Arduino.","","978-1-4799-6795-7","10.1109/iTAG.2014.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990184","computational thinking;e ducation;games;technology;STEM","Computers;Three-dimensional displays;Programming;Educational institutions;Software;Robots","","17","","12","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As it has already been pointed out in [1] and [2], playing games and solving puzzles are effective in cultivating computational thinking, and our gaming software can be a good tool to cultivate skills regarding “Generalization (Pattern Recognition),” “Abstraction;' and “Algorithms” of computational thinking. Our software “n-Queens Problem for Education” is based on the well-known “The n-Queens Puzzle,” which involves solving a puzzle of placing eight chess queens on an n × n chessboard so that they do not attack one another. This puzzle is a good way for students to learn computational thinking. Since this software shows the queens' moves and evaluates solutions, you can concentrate on using your brain without writing down the moves or erasing wrong solutions. In addition, this software has features such as the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board that help users study their solutions.","2378-8143","978-1-7281-3575-5","10.1109/GCCE46687.2019.9015331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9015331","Computational Thinking;iOS Application;n-Queens Problem;Algorithmic Thinking;Problem Solving Skills","Education;Software;Games;Pattern recognition;Software algorithms;Problem-solving;Conferences","","4","","7","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To measure the effectiveness of interventions for the development of Computational Thinking skills, there is a need for valid and reliable assessment tools. Much of the research to date has been concentrated in primary and secondary education with a shortfall in research for higher education settings. This research aims to try and address this gap and is comprised of three main stages: a literature review; a pre-pilot study; and a pilot study. The literature review identified a validated tool with potential for use with undergraduate Computing students. The pre-pilot and pilot studies invited participants to engage with the tool, but engagement was limited with low participation rates. This paper examines the reasons for this and explores possible ways to move the research forward considering these challenges.","","979-8-3315-4278-8","10.1109/EDUNINE62377.2025.10981347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10981347","Computational Thinking;Assessment;Higher Education","Reliability;Engineering education;Systematic literature review","","","","23","IEEE","5 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

(2) Measure the relationship between the applicability of CT concepts with the ease of use, usefulness, attitude and intention to work in the future with an instructional program. (3) Establish the percentages and means of the items of the variables concepts CT and self-efficacy. Thus, from a quantitative approach, we propose to create a questionnaire to measure self-efficacy and the level of knowledge acquired in block programming. 4 practical workshops of 2 hours each have been carried out with 28 initial training students between the ages of 23 and 27. The results yielded a positive correlation between the variables self-efficacy and computational thinking.

This is usually because the software teams fail to completely understand the user requirements. Agile framework and Design Thinking framework can be used together to gain customer empathy and to overcome this problem. This study discusses how Agile framework and Design Thinking supports the same principles and can be used to reduce software development failures.

Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.","","978-1-7281-8038-0","10.1109/ICAICTA49861.2020.9429049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9429049","interaction design;computational thinking;game;user-centered design;prototype;usability testing","Measurement;User centered design;Prototypes;Games;User interfaces;User experience;Usability","","1","","18","IEEE","19 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
