Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.",2377-634X,978-1-4244-6262-9,10.1109/FIE.2010.5673139,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673139,Abstraction;Algorithm;Computational Math;Model;Thinking,Computers;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Books;Mathematical model,,10.0,,25.0,IEEE,23 Dec 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,9

This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature.

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems.

To find computationally rich designs that are appealing to learners, we conducted data analysis on an online makerspace which exploits computational design tools for personal fabrication. We found the most liked designs of the online makerspace and examined which of them included programming features (iterations, conditional statements and functions/modules) and could foster computational thinking elements such as abstract and algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, and decomposition. The most liked category of designs was Figures (of animals and popular animation characters among other things) which surprisingly often also included programming features. We discuss the implications of our research for technologists, academics and teachers who wish to include 3D modeling and printing in coding learning activities.",2165-9567,978-1-5386-9506-7,10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725202,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725202,3D printing;personal fabrication;computational design;computational thinking;online makerspace,Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays;Fabrication;Solid modeling;Encoding;Computational modeling,,3.0,,27.0,IEEE,30 May 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks.

Can computational thinking reduce marginalization in the future Internet?,P. Wentworth,"Department of Computer Science, Rhodes University, South Africa",2010 ITU-T Kaleidoscope: Beyond the Internet? - Innovations for Future Networks and Services,6 Jan 2011,2010,,,1,5,"Maths is presently regarded as the key driver that underpins Science, Education and Technology (SET) skills. In spite of significant studies, investment and efforts, math skills and widespread enthusiasm for SET remain elusive. In South Africa's disadvantaged communities, poor quality maths teaching and poor maths performance, both legacies of past political engineering, further fuel marginalization. Computational thinking is a new characterization of some specific procedural thinking, abstraction, problem solving and organizational skills that are finding their way from computer science programs into other fields. The paper describes our refocus of content in BingBee, a SET skill-building kiosk project targeting disadvantaged communities. As we shift to emphasize computational thinking more explicitly, we speculate that these skills could complement, and perhaps eventually displace, some elements of maths as the dominant driver of SET. The confluence of better tools, open service interfaces, and the rapid spread of handsets and devices into marginalized communities is an opportunity to build more widespread computational thinking skills. This could in turn facilitate a future Internet which is more inclusive, and in which users are able to create their own services.",,978-1-4244-8272-6,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5682137,Computational thinking;problem solving;abstraction;cognitive skills;marginalized communities,Games;Internet;Computer science;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Mathematics,,,,10.0,,6 Jan 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

The original version of TechCheck was validated in first and second graders and consists of 15 multiple choice unplugged challenges drawn from six CT domains. The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience. Participants completed the assessment in an average of 23.43 minutes. TechCheck-K scores were normally distributed (M =8.26, SD =2.33).

In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion.

Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology.

Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity.

Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.",2165-9567,979-8-3503-9402-3,10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578918,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578918,Microworlds;Digital Twin;STEM;Computational Thinking;Proportional Reasoning,Computers;Instruments;Conferences;Toy manufacturing industry;Documentation;Cognition;Digital twins,,,,29.0,IEEE,8 Jul 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution.

It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines,"" using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.",1932-8540,,10.1109/RITA.2018.2809940,EU Erasmus + Programme through KA2 Project “TACCLE 3–Coding”(grant numbers:2015-1-BE02-KA201-012307); European Commission; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8305482,Computational thinking;decision making;game-based learning;ethics;logic;moral machines;self-driving car,Ethics;Europe;Decision making;Technological innovation;Training;Computer science,,11.0,,44.0,IEEE,1 Mar 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,6,7

Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash.

In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.",,978-1-5090-6595-0,10.1109/IWSC.2017.7880506,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880506,,Cloning;Software;Sprites (computer);Programming profession;Parallel processing;Visualization,,31.0,,23.0,IEEE,20 Mar 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.",2377-634X,978-1-5386-1174-6,10.1109/FIE.2018.8658859,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658859,21st century competences;digital competences;design thinking;computational thinking;school;challenge;teacher education;sustainability,Conferences;Technological innovation;Prototypes;Educational technology;Stakeholders,,5.0,,25.0,IEEE,7 Mar 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,10

Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962505,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962505,Computational Thinking;Collaboration;Undergraduate Instruction;Qualitative Research;Data Science,Codes;Federated learning;Semantics;Collaboration;Writing;Syntactics;Problem-solving,,,,21.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,4

These advancements are poised to make a particularly significant impact in low-income and middle-income countries, which are disproportionately affected by worsening pathology service shortages and rising cancer rates. Courses targeted towards undergraduate students interested in this emergent field of computational pathology (CPATH) are required to prepare the next generation of innovators and leaders in this space. However, such training courses have mostly been lacking and their design presents with several challenges. CPATH exists at the intersection of multiple complex specialties and so, following a traditional bottom-up curriculum, courses are often limited to the graduate level. In addition, standard didactic courses struggle to keep with the rapid pace of advancements driving the field, build the essential multidisciplinary teamwork skills, train the technical skillsets required for success, or emphasize innovation. Structured experiential learning (EL) has a long track record of success in addressing these issues and presents as a natural modality for early CPATH education. We have designed and piloted a project based EL course targeted towards undergraduates to address these limitations in CPATH education. At the core of the course experience, students work together to conceptualize, design, and implement innovative solutions to leverage CPATH towards addressing global health inequity. Here we present our design of the course, review insights from our first two years of piloting this course and share plans for course improvement drawn from these insights.Clinical relevance— CPATH is making a significant impact on the practice of pathology and is poised to play a major role in addressing global health inequities.

We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program.

Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking.

One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.",,979-8-3503-0268-4,10.1109/ICOCO59262.2023.10397736,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10397736,UTAUT;computational thinking;unplugged learning,Surveys;Correlation;Computational modeling;Hybrid learning,,,,31.0,IEEE,24 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.",2377-634X,978-1-6654-6244-0,10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962606,Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory,Presses;Correlation;Keyboards;Cognitive load;Task analysis;Programming profession,,2.0,,14.0,IEEE,29 Nov 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,4

Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged.

Students were asked to programmatically choreograph dance performances for virtual characters within an educational desktop application we built earlier called Virtual Environment Interactions (VEnvI). As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain.

The aim of this paper is to propose a fuzzy assessment model formalised according to Reiter's Theory of Diagnosis to reduce this uncertainty and to draw a distinction between the level of students' ability and the degree of guessing. The provided assessment model was tested on modelled answers with respect to the knowledge frameworks and validated in a real-world context.

Teaching Structured Authoring and DITA Through Rhetorical and Computational Thinking,C. Evia; M. R. Sharp; M. A.

This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.",1558-1500,,10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393614,Abstractions;computer languages;DITA;documentation;rhetoric;standards;writing;XML,Documentation;Content management;Computer languages;XML;Rhetoric;Writing,,22.0,,40.0,IEEE,26 Jan 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,6,8

Deployment of physics simulation apps using Easy JavaScript Simulations,,,2017 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON),8 Jun 2017,2017,,,1093,1096,"Physics simulations are widely used to improve the learning process in science and engineering education. Deployment of a computational physics simulation/model is extremely complex given the fact that both knowledge and skills for the science equations and the computational and programming aspects are required for a fully functional simulation, typically requiring a science educator and computer scientists/developer to work together. However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android.

The platform has been designed with the aim to address both the problems detected as the educational gaps associated to the acquisition of the algorithmic thinking needed in the conceptualization and structuring of a program or algorithm determined. To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms. Thereby, the educational concept of the platform takes into account the challenges related to the mobility of technology, learning and the learner. As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area.

Grammar Instruction with UML,M. Rottenhofer; T. Rankin; B. Sabitzer,"Dept. of STEM Education, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria; C. for Business Language & Intercultural Communication, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria; Dept. of STEM Education, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria",2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),4 Dec 2020,2020,,,1,5,"Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-8961-1,10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274063,modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking,Grammar;Unified modeling language;Education;Computational modeling;Informatics;Computer science;Tools,,2.0,,28.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,4

In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels.

However, novice learners often struggle to understand basic computing concepts, such as variables, loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions. This is often caused by the invisibility of the computing mechanism and the complexity of language syntax and conventions. Moreover, challenges in learning computing concepts can be compounded for learners with atypical conditions (e.g. visual, cognitive, and learning impairment, attention deficit, and neurodivergence). To tackle this, teachers of typical ability learners frequently use notional machines (NMs) - simplified representations (e.g. diagrams, flow charts, and analogies) created to assist novice programmers in understanding abstract concepts, program execution, and dynamics. In addition, traditional learning activities may need assistive learning interventions (ALIs) and learner-oriented practices like physical tactile models, computing artifacts, and interactive learning tools. NM approaches tend to focus on the explanation of concepts from instructor to learner, while ALIs tend to focus on learner support in activities. Both methods can provide advantages for learning, and we expect that a combined approach would provide even greater synergy for all learners. However, little consideration has been given to how NM and ALI approaches could be effectively combined. This research investigates how NM and ALI can be effectively brought together more holistically as an inclusive pedagogical tool - notional machines for inclusive learning (NMIL). In this full paper, we develop the conceptualization of NMIL, grounded in previous NM and ALI research. We also propose a structured method for creating NMIL.

Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories.

(2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.",,978-1-5090-0151-4,10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296518,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296518,,Physics;Statistics;Sociology;Computational modeling;User experience;Training;Textiles,,6.0,,,IEEE,12 Oct 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,8

Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements,M. Andrzejewska; A.

One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981,Scientific Research Fund of the Pedagogical University of Krakow; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994685,Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems,Flowcharts;Codes;Gaze tracking;Task analysis;Computer languages;Education;Programming profession,,3.0,,40.0,CCBY,20 Dec 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,6,7
Exploring the Design and Implementation of a Robotic-Coding Camp in Teacher Education,P. Y. Arslan; F. Kayali,"Centre for Teacher Education, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Centre for Teacher Education, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria",2023 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),5 Jan 2024,2023,,,1,5,"This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method.

Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design.

However, crafting pedagogical HRI designs and robot interventions that have a real, positive impact on participants' learning, as well as effectively measuring such impact, is still an open challenge. As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.",1944-9437,978-1-7281-6075-7,10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223343,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223343,educational robotics;collaborative problem solving;computational thinking;engagement;mutual modelling;robot perception;human-robot interaction,Conferences;Humanoid robots;Collaboration;Particle measurements;Collaborative work;Task analysis;Robots,,10.0,,27.0,IEEE,14 Oct 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.",2165-9567,978-1-7281-8478-4,10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453973,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453973,Programming education;Scratch;Game development;Computational Thinking;K-12,Conferences;Games;Programming;Market research;Software;Trajectory;Engineering education,,4.0,,27.0,IEEE,18 Jun 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,7

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to evaluate the effectiveness of such a computing curriculum in improving the learning of computational thinking concepts (CTCs: flow control, data representation, abstraction, user-interactivity, synchronization, parallelism, and logic) by comparing computing projects developed by two groups of students (Potential Development Middle School (PDMS) and Rich Center for Autism (RCA)) of twenty-one students with ASD and by investigating the progressive improvement of a total of 312 computing projects developed by students (138 in PDMS and 174 in RCA) over 20 sessions. Students in both groups were equal in their knowledge of CTCs at the pretest, and RCA and PDMS groups were taught utilizing the accessible and original CT curriculums, respectively, in this experimental study. The results showed that the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective in learning of logic. Additionally, when all seven CTCs as a single construct were examined, the original CT curriculum was statistically significantly more effective than the accessible one. Furthermore, an investigation of the gradual increase in students' computing project scores throughout 20 sessions showed that both curriculums were statistically significantly effective in progressively improving students' learning of data representation, abstraction, synchronization, parallelism, and all CTCs as a single construct.

Students should be probed for understanding, reasoning and critical thinking abilities rather than their ability to return memorized facts. The Department of Energy's pilot program, Adventures in Supercomputing (AiS), offers one example of assessment techniques developed for learner-centered curricula. The goals and objectives that are central to student learning in the AiS program involve the acquisition of thinking and problem-solving skills. School students are involved in a year-long computational science project. To complete the project, students employ the following tools: (1) the Internet to aid in researching their topics and communicating with their mentors, (2) computers to develop and test models of the problems, and (3) visualization software to understand their data. From these resources, students must pose hypotheses, devise methods for solutions, conduct appropriate simulations and draw proper conclusions. The assessment of the AiS program has employed a variety of methods to collect student data. THe methods of assessment used were traditional testing, performance testing, interviews, questionnaires via e-mail, and student presentations of projects. The data obtained have been analyzed by a professional assessment team. The results have been used to improve the AiS curriculum and establish the quality of the overall AiS program.

However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires.

In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence.

Thus, any model of teaching/learning should include a unique component of human interaction (i.e., interaction between instructors and students) to make such models appropriate for implementation. The nature of online courses is such that there is no physical interaction between the instructors and students. Thus, the development and implementation of these models, with constructive collaboration between students and instructors in mind, is more challenging for the instructors.

A categorisation of the identified serious games was developed in order to analyse the characteristics of the serious games - the aspects they covered and those they do not cover. Of primary importance were the simulation level, topic and skills mediated by the identified serious games. The ""simulation level"" means the level or amount of the world that is simulated in the simulation or serious game. This is a hierarchy starting with the World/ God/ Universe - in which level whole worlds are simulated, for example, in games such as Civilization. The hierarchy then proceeds downwards from nation, industry, inter-organisational, business/ organisation, intra-organisational/ processes, group/ team, discipline, techniques to games addressing the individual. Second the skills to be transferred by the serious game were also analysed. From this an analysis of the gaps in coverage of serious games was carried out, leading to identifying opportunities for, and recommendations of, serious games to be developed for the business and industry domain.",,978-3-943024-05-0,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6041266,Serious Games;State of the Art;Training;Business and Industry,Games;Business;Industries;Production;Training;Computers;Computational modeling,,4.0,,17.0,,10 Oct 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,4

Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used across the undergraduate engineering curriculum to help actively engaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena which are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman.
