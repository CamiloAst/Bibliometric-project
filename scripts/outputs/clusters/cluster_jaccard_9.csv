Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers.

We introduced a Bee-Bot computer simulator for children to learn sequencing. Our study adopted a pretest-posttest method involving 35 grade two students. The Computational Thinking Test for Beginners (BCTt) was used to assess CT abilities, and the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was utilized to measure learning motivation. We found a significant improvement in sequencing ability and more advanced CT concepts (loops and conditions) and a significant correlation between those concepts. Departing from the existing literature, we delved deeper into how Bee-Bot's influence on sequencing extended to more advanced CT concepts. Moreover, considering the ARCS motivation model, this study examined how Bee-Bot affects learning motivation at the primary education level. After the intervention, the findings revealed that the students showed significantly higher learning motivation, meaning that the different learning activities using the Bee-Bot simulator positively influenced various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The correlation between the IMMS scores and the BCTt outcomes further suggested that enhanced motivation positively correlated with better CT abilities.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-5150-7,10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893369,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893369,Bee-Bot;Computational thinking;Sequencing;Learning motivation;K-12 programming education,Surveys;Sequential analysis;Correlation;Educational robots;Computational modeling;Educational technology;Solids;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Next generation networking,,,,21.0,IEEE,26 Feb 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,6,9

In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-1746-1,10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028492,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028492,Computational Thinking;K-12 Education;Teacher Education;Distance Learning,Computed tomography;Programming profession;Computer aided instruction;Tools,,4.0,,18.0,IEEE,12 Mar 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,9

Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours.

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test.

The cognitive revolution and its implications for creating knowledge tools needed in achieving a sustainable society,J. L. Miller,"KnowledgeNet, Toronto, ONT, Canada",Proceedings 1995 Interdisciplinary Conference: Knowledge Tools for a Sustainable Civilization. Fourth Canadian Conference on Foundations and Applications of General Science Theory,6 Aug 2002,1995,,,235,244,"The last 30 years have witnessed a qualitative change in our conception of how people learn (usually called the ""cognitive revolution""), so that we think today not only in terms of acquiring discrete facts and skills but also in far more powerful terms of acquiring new ways of thinking. Of particular importance is the process of acquiring the habits of systematic and disciplined inquiry characteristic of organized science. To the social theorist and policy maker, however, the existence of a new, more powerful view of learning is a mixed blessing. Decisions of how best to implement the lessons of the cognitive revolution require technocratic know-how as well as social and political judgment. I discuss the cognitive revolution by offering a comparison of two contrasting views of education that it has produced, which I call ""institution-centred"" and ""person-centred"" methodologies. In terms of their pedagogical effectiveness, both methodologies have been shown to be successful, when implemented in a congenial social environment by competent professionals. The essential difference is political. An institution-centered methodology has as side-effect to encourage a greater sense of commitment, loyalty and perhaps even dependence in regard to teachers, educational and social institutions and authority figures in general; in contrast, a person-centered methodology encourages a greater sense of autonomy and self-reliance. Cognitive methods can be useful for policy makers with a wide range of priorities and commitments, if correctly chosen.",,0-7803-3365-9,10.1109/KTSC.1995.569179,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569179,,Psychology;Cognitive science;Production;Educational institutions;Animals,,,,13.0,IEEE,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,9

Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools.

Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture.

First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules.

Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems,T. Hirashima,"Dept. Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan",2017 3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech),15 Jan 2018,2017,,,1,6,"Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.",,978-1-5090-5866-2,10.1109/ICSITech.2017.8257076,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257076,Computer-based Intelligence Support;Ill-Structured Problem;Moderately Ill-Structured Problem;Domain Model;Problem Setting;Arithmetic Word Problems,Computational modeling;Information technology;Problem-solving;Monitoring;Numerical models;Artificial intelligence,,2.0,,24.0,IEEE,15 Jan 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,9

The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.",2377-634X,978-1-7281-1746-1,10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028384,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028384,,Robots;Mathematics;Erbium;Education;Problem-solving;Programming,,5.0,,34.0,IEEE,12 Mar 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,9
