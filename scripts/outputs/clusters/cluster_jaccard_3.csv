Comparing with existing models, three changes are made: (1) a pathway called inner loop is added from motor controller to thalamus; (2) a memory controller is added in front of long-term declarative memory, which can judge whether the memory operation is retrieval or not; (3) two new modules, Active Object buffer (AO) and Active Action buffer, are separated out of the general working memory model. With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted. Experiments with ACT-R indicate that CAUT is consistent with ACT-R in functional level, and the description can be easily transformed into ACT-R model, and CAUT architecture can be taken as a meta-description and design tool to construct cognitive model.

A Model of Computational Creativity based on Engram Cell Theory,Q. Li; B. Li,"Washinton Institute for Health Sciences, Arlington, VA, USA; Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA",2023 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI),2 Aug 2023,2023,,,272,273,"Artificial Intelligence technology has made remarkable progress in machine learning, but it is still in its infancy in creative thinking or computational creativity. In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles.

Recent basic studies reveal that AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the adoption of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from the deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by a cognitive systems.

A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described.

So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory.

A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics.

Next Bar Predictor: An Architecture in Automated Music Generation,B. M. Dungan; P. L.

With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.",,978-1-7281-4988-2,10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182341,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9182341,Computer generated music;machine learning;artificial intelligence,Bars;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Decision trees;Multilayer perceptrons;Training;Machine learning,,1.0,,20.0,IEEE,1 Sep 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,3

We think this invention is necessary for intelligent behavior in any organism, artificial or otherwise, since it has been observed repeatedly that systems with fixed symbol sets get stuck. This observation is well-known in computing circles, and has been observed in ""extensible"" languages, large and growing knowledge bases, content-based filing systems for technical literature, and inheritance hierarchies for large object-oriented systems: no matter what elaboration mechanisms are used, no matter what initial structures are used, the structures eventually become too constrained by what is already there, and stagnate. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms (which include the alphabet, as the mechanisms for constructing expressions from nothing), that is, the basic units that combine or are combined to make the structures, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which for us is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems.

Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction.

Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.",,978-1-4244-8343-3,10.1109/ICRESH.2010.5779541,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779541,Simulation approach;time dependent availability analysis;Markov approach;complex systems;system dynamics;Markov System Dynamics,Availability;Analytical models;Markov processes;Computational modeling;Numerical models,,2.0,,14.0,IEEE,27 May 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,3

Traditional machine learning technologies deal with object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, and behavior acquisition. This paper presents a supervised machine knowledge learning methodology for concept elicitation from sample dictionaries in natural languages. Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base. The results of machine-generated concepts demonstrate that the AMCE algorithm can over perform human knowledge expressions in dictionaries in terms of relevance, accuracy, quantitativeness, and cohesiveness.",,978-1-5090-3846-6,10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862015,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862015,Machine learning;cognitive robots;concept elicitation;experiment;formal concepts;knowledge extraction;knowledge representation;concept algebra;cognitive knowledge base;algorithms,Algebra;Handheld computers;Writing;Instruments;Animals;Semantics,,12.0,,52.0,IEEE,23 Feb 2017,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,3,3
