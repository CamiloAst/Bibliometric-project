Sci. & Technol., Ludong Univ., Yantai",2009 First International Workshop on Education Technology and Computer Science,26 May 2009,2009,1.0,,503,507,"The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools.

The AProS Project: Strategic Thinking & Computational Logic,W. Sieg,,Logic Journal of the IGPL,18 Jan 2018,2007,15.0,4.0,359,368,"The paper discusses tools for teaching logic used in Logic & Proofs, a web-based introduction to modern logic that has been taken by more than 1,300 students since the fall of 2003. The tools include a wide array of interactive learning environments or cognitive mini-tutors; most important among them is the Carnegie Proof Lab. The Proof Lab is a sophisticated interface for constructing natural deduction proofs and is central, as strategically guided discovery of proofs is the distinctive focus of the course. My discussion makes explicit the broader intellectual context, but also the pursuit of pedagogical goals and their experimental examination. The intellectual context includes i) the theoretical background for the proof search algorithm AProS and its use for a dynamic Proof Tutor, and ii) the programmatic expansion of the course to Computational Logic. (I recommend that the reader enter the virtual classroom of Logic & Proofs: the interactive components just cannot be properly reflected in a narrative. It is also very easy to download AProS and observe its ways of searching for proofs.) 1",1368-9894,,10.1093/jigpal/jzm026,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8131700,introduction to logic;strategic thinking;automated proof search;dynamic proof tutor;Carnegie Proof Lab;Open Learning Initiative (OLI);intercalation calculus;natural deduction proof,,,,,,,18 Jan 2018,,,OUP,OUP Journals,4,7

With CAUT architecture, a dynamic cognitive model is put out with which typical thinking processes can be interpreted and described more precisely. Problem solving are demonstrated with this model, and two typical problems, decision problem and search problem, are interpreted.

A Model of Computational Creativity based on Engram Cell Theory,Q. Li; B.

In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles.

In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data. This transformation reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining essential similarity information. In the logical layer, Bayesian inference is employed to classify testing samples, mirroring human thought processes.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. This course will look at the synergies that are required across the stack from new devices to new computational models for designing future computing systems. This course will enable attendees to understand the inter-twined nature of design optimization that requires one to interact with experts in different domains. The students will be exposed to simulation tools and modelling techniques to help explore new circuits and architectures. As physical dimensional scaling alone has ceased to be the key factor driving the industry, many innovations have occurred in designing new types of logic switches including changes to their structure (such as three-dimensional FinFETs), their underlying physics (use of tunneling for steep-switching devices), the material systems (integration of ferro-electrics in gate stack for Negative Capacitance FETs). The first part of the lecture will introduce these devices, simulation models and accompanying circuit innovations. There has been a world of revolution in the memory devices with the emergence of many nonvolatile memory technologies and their tight integration in cross-point architectures. These memory systems have enabled new styles of computing systems such as the non-volatile processor for internet of thing systems and neuromorphic computing systems for cognitive computing. The lectures will focus on the synergistic coordination in advances in devices to system design. Neuromorphic systems also leverage new advances in technology such as cross-point memory arrays to integrate computing and store. Another emerging novel computational model is based on the principle “let physics do the computation”. This technique focuses on using the intrinsic operation mechanism of devices (such as nanoscale electronic coupled oscillators) to do the computation, instead of building complex circuits with standard transistors to carry out the same function. The primary objective is to train the next generation researchers and practitioners that can understand the synergy across the stack from devices to applications. This will prepare the next generation workforce for the beyond Moore era using post-CMOS devices and new computational paradigms beyond Von-Neumann computing models. This course will introduce the following topics: [1] Emerging logic and memory devices: What value do they add for circuit designers/architects?

However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic.

To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks.

This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, ‘systemic critique’, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, ‘systemic pluralism’, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, ‘systemic improvement’, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to ‘systemic pragmatism’. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>",,9781394203581,10.1002/9781394203604.ch3,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10534124.pdf&bkn=10534082&pdfType=chapter,,Systems thinking;Complexity theory;Floods;Adaptation models;Stakeholders;Observers;Computational modeling,,,,,,17 May 2024,,,Wiley,Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters,4,4

The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico.

Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking. The model utilizes a top-down approach for understanding the factors involved in the thought process while explaining the factors involved.

In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information.

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.",1557-9638,,10.1109/TE.2024.3442612,"Project KEGA titled by The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Teaching of School Informatics in Secondary Schools(grant numbers:010UPJŠ-4/2024); Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic titled by Proposal of Novel Methods in the Field of Formal Concept Analysis and their Application(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0645/22); Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-20-0069); Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA)(grant numbers:VEGA 2/0097/20); Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure (OPII) through “InoCHF—Research and Development in the Field of Innovative Technologies in the Management of Patients with CHF,” co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:313011BWH2); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10669100,Attribute implications;formal concept analysis;light-bot;visualization,Games;Formal concept analysis;Education;Lighting;Programming profession;Lattices;Robots,,,,43.0,IEEE,6 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,4,4

We propose a new algorithm, the Concrete-Category Overlap (CCO) algorithm, that distinguishes between literal and metaphorical use of adjective-noun relationships and evaluate it on two data sets of adjective-noun phrases. Our results point to the superiority of the CCO algorithm to past and contemporary approaches in determining the presence and conceptual significance of metaphors, and provide a better understanding of the conditions under which each algorithm should be applied.",,978-1-4673-5871-2,10.1109/CCMB.2013.6609166,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609166,computational intelligence;natural language processing;metaphor;computational linguistics,Decision support systems;Computational intelligence;Handheld computers;Abstracts,,11.0,2.0,17.0,IEEE,26 Sep 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described. The domain is that of collisions among bodies moving in a straight line, with no frictional resistance.",,,10.1049/ic:19960052,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=646161,,,,,,,,6 Aug 2002,,,IET,IET Conferences,4,3

MVMDP is a generalization of partially observable Markov decision process, and reflects an important characteristic of human thought: that people, under the possibility that they grasp the whole states (i.e., appropriately measure the state space), think of problems and can choose their own optimal actions. So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems.

Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module.

On bounded rationality in cyber-physical systems security: Game-theoretic analysis with application to smart grid protection,A. Sanjab; W. Saad,"Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, US; Wireless@VT, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA",2016 Joint Workshop on Cyber- Physical Security and Resilience in Smart Grids (CPSR-SG),27 Oct 2016,2016,,,1,6,"In this paper, a general model for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), that captures the diffusion of attacks from the cyber layer to the physical system, is studied. In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability.",,978-1-5090-1164-3,10.1109/CPSRSG.2016.7684101,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7684101,,Security;Games;Smart grids;Cyber-physical systems;Nash equilibrium;Silicon;Computational modeling,,31.0,,22.0,IEEE,27 Oct 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

We applied a novel computational method of verbal creativity assessment—semantic distance—and performed weighted degree functional connectivity analyses to explore how individual differences in assembly of resting-state networks are associated with this objective creativity assessment. To measure creative performance, a sample of healthy adults (n = 175) completed a battery of divergent thinking (DT) tasks, in which they were asked to think of unusual uses for everyday objects. Computational semantic models were applied to calculate the semantic distance between objects and responses to obtain an objective measure of DT performance. All participants underwent resting-state imaging, from which we computed voxel-wise connectivity matrices between all gray matter voxels. A linear regression analysis was applied between DT and weighted degree of the connectivity matrices. Our analysis revealed a significant connectivity decrease in the visual-temporal and parietal regions, in relation to increased levels of DT. Link-level analyses showed higher local connectivity within visual regions was associated with lower DT, whereas projections from the precuneus to the right inferior occipital and temporal cortex were positively associated with DT.

Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).",1941-0506,,10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934797,NSERC; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807301,Think-aloud;visual analytics;machine intelligence;user study;usability problems;session review behavior;UX practices,Usability;Visual analytics;Tools;Machine intelligence;Feature extraction;Machine learning,,5.0,,45.0,IEEE,20 Aug 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,4,4

A Framework to Overcome the Dark Side of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) Like ChatGPT in Social Media and Education,P. W. Kim,"Department of Korean Language Education, Incheon National University, Incheon, South Korea",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,16 Aug 2024,2024,11.0,4.0,5266,5274,"As the performance of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT, improves, content created by GAI will be distributed in the social media space, and knowledge and writings from unknown sources will be disseminated and reproduced. Now that GAI is becoming widespread, it is necessary to distinguish GAI from human intelligence, which constitutes knowledge. The data, information, knowledge, and work (DIKW) hierarchy is a useful framework for teaching and for checking metacognitive and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) literacy. There are two types of collaboration between GAI and human intelligence: a combined intelligence model and a parallel intelligence model. The combined intelligence model is a method of using GAI for creating works by collecting data, organizing information, and deriving knowledge from information.

However, existing methods assume that the texture of the entire image is domain-specific and irrelevant to class-specific representations. These methods enhance all regions with a single style, which can result in information loss. In this work, we propose CLAP (Cross-modality Local Augmentation for histoPathology), a data augmentation approach that enables cross-modality local manipulation for pathology images. Specifically, the combination of a text extractor network and a feature mapping network enables the integration of CLIP embeddings for style descriptions into editable latent spaces at a fine-grained level. This approach prevents the loss of regional information in whole-slide images, eliminates the need to painstakingly select directions in latent space, and enhances creativity style selection. Experimental results demonstrate that CLAP improves the regional accuracy of cross-modality editing and achieves state-of-the-art performance by enhancing generalization in histopathology classification tasks.",2156-1133,979-8-3503-8622-6,10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822842,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822842,style transfer;medical image data augmentation;cross-modality;local manipulation,Adaptation models;Accuracy;Histopathology;Feature extraction;Data augmentation;Computational efficiency;Bioinformatics;Creativity;Biomedical imaging,,,,7.0,IEEE,10 Jan 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence.

Using GPT-4 as a case study, we designed two agents: IntelliStorm (based on the unstructured brainstorming method) and EvoluTRIZ (based on the structured TRIZ method). Thirty participants were recruited, and through two experimental phases spaced one month apart, a comparative analysis of the effects of collaboration groups (human-agent vs. human-human) and concept generation methods (brainstorming vs. TRIZ) on participants’ physiological activation and creative thinking performance were conducted. The results show that the involvement of LLM-based agents can effectively reduce participants’ electrodermal activity(EDA) response levels, indicating a reduction in cognitive load. Moreover, participants maintained their distinct physiological patterns and performance advantages across different concept generation methods. For example, IntelliStorm, like brainstorming, evokes stronger responses to information stimuli, demonstrating superior thinking fluency; EvoluTRIZ, like the TRIZ, exhibits a higher frequency of information responses, showcasing enhanced thinking elaboration. However, originality tends to favor human-human collaboration.

Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user's actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user's sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user.

To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040169,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268157,Artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project success;prediction models;systems thinking,Software;Predictive models;Stakeholders;Project management;Artificial neural networks;Systems thinking;Complexity theory,,13.0,,106.0,CCBY,24 Nov 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,4,4

The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described – engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as ‘dominant’ at different times to steer interventions.

Next Bar Predictor: An Architecture in Automated Music Generation,B. M. Dungan; P. L. Fernandez,"Computer Science, Ateneo de Manila University Loyola Heights, Quezon City, Philippines; Ateneo de Manila University Loyola Heights, Quezon City, Philippines",2020 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP),1 Sep 2020,2020,,,109,113,"Music generation has been an active field of research in computer science and is considered as a creative task attempting to imitate human creativity. With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.",,978-1-7281-4988-2,10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182341,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9182341,Computer generated music;machine learning;artificial intelligence,Bars;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Decision trees;Multilayer perceptrons;Training;Machine learning,,1.0,,20.0,IEEE,1 Sep 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,3

Situation assessment in computational semiotics,C.

We think this invention is necessary for intelligent behavior in any organism, artificial or otherwise, since it has been observed repeatedly that systems with fixed symbol sets get stuck. This observation is well-known in computing circles, and has been observed in ""extensible"" languages, large and growing knowledge bases, content-based filing systems for technical literature, and inheritance hierarchies for large object-oriented systems: no matter what elaboration mechanisms are used, no matter what initial structures are used, the structures eventually become too constrained by what is already there, and stagnate. To change that phenomenon, we need construction mechanisms that can themselves be changed and elaborated. We think that if we can change the construction mechanisms (which include the alphabet, as the mechanisms for constructing expressions from nothing), that is, the basic units that combine or are combined to make the structures, then we have another way to escape the trap of creeping rigidity: we can elaborate the units out from underneath the existing structures. This brings us directly to computational semiotics, which for us is the study of the treatment and use of symbols in computing systems. This paper is primarily intended to stimulate discussion and further research in these areas, since the questions are very hard and have no easy answers.",2158-9860,0-7803-4423-5,10.1109/ISIC.1998.713807,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=713807,,Postal services;Computational and artificial intelligence;Organisms;Knowledge based systems,,3.0,,19.0,IEEE,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,3

Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges.

Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods.

Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.",,978-0-9960-0787-0,10.23919/ROPACES.2018.8364197,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8364197,Numerical Linear Algebra;Sparse Matrix Direct Methods;Finite Element Methods,Sparse matrices;Finite element analysis;Matrix decomposition;Iterative methods;Symmetric matrices;Electromagnetics;Computational modeling,,,,3.0,,24 May 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4
Computational Creativity by Generative Adversial Network with Leaked Information,S. Ghosh; A. Konar; A. K. Nagar,"Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Department, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Jadavpur University, India; Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Department, Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Jadavpur University, India; Department of Math and Computer Science, Liverpool Hope University, Liverpool, UK",2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),9 Sep 2024,2024,,,1,8,"Computational creativity is defined as the ability of artificial systems to generate artifacts with substantial novelty and originality, comparable to those crafted by human experts. This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.",2161-4407,979-8-3503-5931-2,10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650943,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10650943,computational creativity;LeakGAN;trigonometric identities;CNN,Geometry;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Generative adversarial networks;Mathematical models;Generators;Data models,,,,41.0,IEEE,9 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

On the fusion and transference of knowledge. II,S. H. Rubin,"SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego, CA, USA",Proceedings Fifth IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications,8 Jan 2004,2003,,,150,159,"Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, ""a society of mind"". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.",,0-7803-8242-0,10.1109/IRI.2003.1251408,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251408,,Reflection;Working environment noise;Humans;Vehicles;Object oriented modeling;Cost function;Neural networks;Operational amplifiers;Ontologies;USA Councils,,,,27.0,IEEE,8 Jan 2004,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones.

Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios.

We present an approach to an agent's belief dynamics, that simulates denial and wishful thinking, using the agent's goals as the source of affective preference. Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors.

In this paper we borrow some immunity flavor and add it to the framework of MC. The new addition is a way of thinking and designing MC algorithms. It eliminates the need for a checking phase in an MC algorithm. There can be many interpretations for the concept of adding Immunity to P systems. In this paper, one interpretation is introduced in which Immunity is interpreted as a set of rules that protects membranes against generation or evolution of unwanted objects.

This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation.

The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat.

This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands.

In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period.

ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt.

From a computational intelligence perspective, a holon can be conceived as a goal-oriented community of lower-level holons led by more specific targets. Sub-holons co-operate on sub-problems that represent the source problem at a lower knowledge abstraction level. Such a (recursive) hierarchical organization constitutes the so-called holarchy. Holonic thinking is hence particularly suited for complex and intelligent systems modeling: in particular, its success has been proved in the field of Intelligent Manufacturing. Nevertheless, albeit hierarchical and granular thinking are two fundamental prerequisites in Software Engineering, the use of holonic thinking as software paradigm is still flawing in the literature at the moment. In this regard, the paper introduces the concept of ‘holonic granule’ as a novel software building-block for modeling complex granular systems.

This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost.

Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.",1949-3045,,10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2908172,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676257,Focused attention meditation;mindfulness;sustained attention;SART;Prims;transfer;emotion regulation,Computational modeling;Mood;Monitoring;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Emotion recognition,,4.0,,60.0,IEEE,29 Mar 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,4,4

We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance.

We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard.

We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.",1873-7951,,10.1093/iwc/iwu022,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155009,development frameworks and environments;designing software;interactive learning environments;computational thinking;informal learning,,,5.0,,,,18 Jan 2018,,,OUP,OUP Journals,4,7

We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses.

We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance.

The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques.

The cognitive revolution and its implications for creating knowledge tools needed in achieving a sustainable society,J. L. Miller,"KnowledgeNet, Toronto, ONT, Canada",Proceedings 1995 Interdisciplinary Conference: Knowledge Tools for a Sustainable Civilization. Fourth Canadian Conference on Foundations and Applications of General Science Theory,6 Aug 2002,1995,,,235,244,"The last 30 years have witnessed a qualitative change in our conception of how people learn (usually called the ""cognitive revolution""), so that we think today not only in terms of acquiring discrete facts and skills but also in far more powerful terms of acquiring new ways of thinking. Of particular importance is the process of acquiring the habits of systematic and disciplined inquiry characteristic of organized science. To the social theorist and policy maker, however, the existence of a new, more powerful view of learning is a mixed blessing. Decisions of how best to implement the lessons of the cognitive revolution require technocratic know-how as well as social and political judgment. I discuss the cognitive revolution by offering a comparison of two contrasting views of education that it has produced, which I call ""institution-centred"" and ""person-centred"" methodologies. In terms of their pedagogical effectiveness, both methodologies have been shown to be successful, when implemented in a congenial social environment by competent professionals. The essential difference is political. An institution-centered methodology has as side-effect to encourage a greater sense of commitment, loyalty and perhaps even dependence in regard to teachers, educational and social institutions and authority figures in general; in contrast, a person-centered methodology encourages a greater sense of autonomy and self-reliance. Cognitive methods can be useful for policy makers with a wide range of priorities and commitments, if correctly chosen.",,0-7803-3365-9,10.1109/KTSC.1995.569179,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=569179,,Psychology;Cognitive science;Production;Educational institutions;Animals,,,,13.0,IEEE,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,9

Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control.

Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community.

We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data.

But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise.

Rajamani,"Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India; College of Engineering, Osmania University, India",2009 IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC),22 Jan 2010,2009,,,163,167,"When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.",,978-1-4244-5338-2,10.1109/APSCC.2009.5394128,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5394128,Association rules;Data mining;Grid computing;High performance,Distributed computing;Grid computing;Biology computing;Chemical technology;Marine technology;Space technology;Application software;Astronomy;Astrochemistry;Data engineering,,1.0,,10.0,IEEE,22 Jan 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

A TDRL Model for the Emotion of Regret,J. Broekens; L. Dai,"Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands; Human Media Interaction, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands",2019 8th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII),9 Dec 2019,2019,,,150,156,"To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.",2156-8111,978-1-7281-3888-6,10.1109/ACII.2019.8925441,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925441,Emotion;TDRL Emotion Theory;Computational Modelling;Regret,Computational modeling;Learning (artificial intelligence);Appraisal;Task analysis;Affective computing;Psychology;Robots,,7.0,,41.0,IEEE,9 Dec 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene, given a reasonably large database of known objects. The system uses massively parallel hypotheses generation and parameter space clustering in place of serial constraint propagation. Local boundary features that constrain an object's position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This greatly reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested. Experiments show that the time required by this approach scales at a much slower range than either the number of objects in the database or objects in the scene.<>",1063-6919,0-8186-0862-5,10.1109/CVPR.1988.196335,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=196335,,Object recognition;Layout;Testing;Spatial databases;Machine vision;Concurrent computing;Image databases;Object oriented databases;Parallel architectures;Image processing,,21.0,,15.0,IEEE,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands.

The creativity mechanisms in embodied agents: An explanatory model,J. Wiedermann,"Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Human-like Intelligence (CIHLI),30 Sep 2013,2013,,,41,47,"In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.",,978-1-4673-5923-8,10.1109/CIHLI.2013.6613263,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613263,,Mirrors;Computational modeling;Semantics;Pragmatics;Abstracts;Oceans;Syntactics,,3.0,,17.0,IEEE,30 Sep 2013,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

Here we investigate these barriers and their features exposing the nature of mental process. We start from special structures which reflect the ways to define relations between objects. Then we came to realizing about what is the material our mind uses to build thoughts, to make conclusions, to understand, to form reasoning, etc. This can be called a mental dynamics. After this the nature of mental barriers on the required level of abstraction as well as the ways to pass through them became clear. We begin to understand why thinking flows in such a way, with such specifics and with such limitations we can observe in reality. This can help us to be more optimal. At the final step we start to understand, what mathematical models can be applied to such a picture.

Analytical techniques become very complicated and unrealistic especially for modern complex systems. There have been attempts in the literature to evolve more realistic techniques using simulation approach for availability analysis of systems. This paper proposes a hybrid approach called as Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach which combines the Markov approach with system dynamics simulation approach for the time dependent availability analysis and to study the dynamic behavior of systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, in the published literature the authors generally assume that repairable systems reach their steady state when operational time reaches infinity. However, in practical situations it is important to know at what time the steady state begins. Therefore, another objective of this paper is to evaluate the time at which repairable multi component systems reach their steady state of operations. The proposed framework is illustrated for multi component systems such as a three component system with one component on standby with a numerical example. The results of the simulation when compared with that obtained by traditional Markov analysis clearly validate the Markov System Dynamics (MSD) approach as an alternative approach for the time dependent availability analysis.",,978-1-4244-8343-3,10.1109/ICRESH.2010.5779541,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5779541,Simulation approach;time dependent availability analysis;Markov approach;complex systems;system dynamics;Markov System Dynamics,Availability;Analytical models;Markov processes;Computational modeling;Numerical models,,2.0,,14.0,IEEE,27 May 2011,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,3

A neural cluster model based on neural network was used to model the mechanism of facial emotions-induced EEG. The EEG activity induced by facial emotion and its spectral characteristics were obtained. In order to improve the recognition accuracy of emotion-driven EEG, the analysis and recognition algorithm of EEG stimulated by expression is studied by combining wavelet with ANN model. The simulation results show that the correct rate of EEG recognition based on neural network is 88.69%. The recognition accuracy of BP neural network is 76.3%, and its convergence speed is also improved. The experimental results show that this method is an effective method for EEG recognition.",,979-8-3503-8098-9,10.1109/EEBDA60612.2024.10485933,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485933,Brain-computer interface;electroencephalogram;neural network;feature extraction,Emotion recognition;Computational modeling;Simulation;Neural networks;Brain modeling;Wavelet analysis;Electroencephalography,,,,9.0,IEEE,8 Apr 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education.

The above two-step process of expansion and testing is developed here using the best-first search (BFS) on an OR-tree, where the nodes denote trial solutions (new creations) and edges represent parent-child connectivity satisfying the rules of the given problem domain. Two alternative extensions of BFS are examined in view of the cost function employed at the nodes to ultimately determine the optimal node in the search tree within a user-defined depth as the solution to the creativity problem. The first algorithm considers maximizing the diversity cost earned by a node with respect to its parent, while the second considers maximizing the difference between the diversity and the penalty cost earned by a node with respect to the root node. The significant contribution of the present research lies in ensuring diversity of the solutions during iterative expansions of the tree as well as the novelty of the optimal solution (best node) across runs of the same program.

In this viewpoint, the seller evaluation in e-commerce is collected knowledge from buyers and synthetic score is computational intelligence because each buyer makes his/her decision whether he/she trades with the seller. In this paper, we discuss the computational intelligence of evaluation system in e-commerce.

Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems,T. Hirashima,"Dept. Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan",2017 3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech),15 Jan 2018,2017,,,1,6,"Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.",,978-1-5090-5866-2,10.1109/ICSITech.2017.8257076,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257076,Computer-based Intelligence Support;Ill-Structured Problem;Moderately Ill-Structured Problem;Domain Model;Problem Setting;Arithmetic Word Problems,Computational modeling;Information technology;Problem-solving;Monitoring;Numerical models;Artificial intelligence,,2.0,,24.0,IEEE,15 Jan 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,9

A New Computational Method for Quantification and Analysis of Media Bias in Cybersecurity Reporting,F. K. Sufi,"COEUS Institute, New Market, VA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,,2025,PP,99.0,1,10,"The proliferation of cyber threats and their representation in news media significantly influence public awareness and policy-making. However, biases in cybersecurity news reporting—manifested as location focus, event significance prioritization, and coverage of specific attack types or industries—distort perceptions and resource allocations. This study addresses these challenges by developing an artificial intelligence-driven computational framework that analyzes and quantifies biases in cybersecurity news. Leveraging a dataset of 1.23 million news articles, which was filtered down to 9314 cybersecurity-related events spanning 144 sources over five quarters, the methodology employs GPT-based classification, Shannon entropy, chi-square tests, multinomial logistic regression, and Bayesian inference to identify patterns and dependencies in reporting. Results reveal that generalized sources such as BBC exhibit high reporting diversity (H = 2.87), while specialized outlets such as Cybersecurity Insider display niche focus (H = 0.45). Multinomial logistic regression achieved 81.2% accuracy in predicting reporting tendencies based on event significance and source characteristics. Bayesian inference highlighted significant tendencies, such as Dark Reading’s preference for advanced persistent threats (posterior probability = 0.62) and CNBC’s emphasis on phishing events (posterior probability = 0.48). Furthermore, this framework can be extended to other open-source media, such as social media platforms, to pinpoint and measure the level of bias exhibited by individual users, marking a significant step toward identifying misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The proposed framework not only provides actionable insights for stakeholders but also establishes a scalable model for analyzing biases in other domains, fostering informed decision-making and balanced reporting practices.",2329-924X,,10.1109/TCSS.2025.3560199,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10988747,Bias detection;bias measurement;media bias analysis;open-source news bias;social perception monitoring,Media;Computer security;Industries;Entropy;Decision making;Analytical models;Posterior probability;Bayes methods;Vectors;Uniform resource locators,,,,,IEEE,5 May 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,4,4

However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type.

Incrementalization of Vertex-Centric Programs,T. A. K. Zakian; L. A. R. Capelli; Z. Hu,"Dept. of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; Information Systems Architecture Research Division, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan",2019 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS),2 Sep 2019,2019,,,1019,1029,"As the graphs in our world become ever larger, the need for programmable, easy to use, and highly scalable graph processing has become ever greater. One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.",1530-2075,978-1-7281-1246-6,10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00109,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821014,Compilers;Vertex-Centric Computation;Incrementalization,Computational modeling;Optimization;Informatics;Writing;Benchmark testing;Programming;Distributed processing,,5.0,,20.0,IEEE,2 Sep 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of ""extremeness"". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.",2374-8486,978-1-7281-8316-9,10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00135,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338429,outlier detection;anomaly detection;copula;data mining,Conferences;Computational modeling;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Computational efficiency;Task analysis;Anomaly detection,,201.0,,14.0,IEEE,9 Feb 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

However, it is possible to impact the whole system via its inputs and observe its reactions via its outputs.

The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution.

The ANFIS model is a fusion of neural networks with learning ability, adaptability, and computational ability, and a fuzzy system with human-like thinking ability and reasoning ability. In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data. Furthermore, we confirmed that the prediction performance of ANFIS model using CFCM clustering method is constant.",,978-1-5386-7266-2,10.1109/IEMCON.2018.8614898,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614898,ANFIS;Input space partitioning method;Prediction,Adaptation models;Clustering methods;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Fuzzy sets,,3.0,,15.0,IEEE,17 Jan 2019,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF.

This dynamics is shaped by external information on task context, constraints and goals, and is modulated by evaluative feedback from an internal critic working through reinforcement. While the model is abstract, it attempts to capture the interplay between semantic representations in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices, working memory in the prefrontal cortex, attentional selection by the basal ganglia, and modulation from the dopaminergic reward system. We show that a context-specific itinerant search for novel but meaningful conceptual combinations (ideas) emerges naturally from the dynamics of this system.

Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.",,978-1-5386-1264-4,10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268242,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268242,information literacy;computational thinking;hyper and deep attention;data structure;webpage conversion,Tools;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Data structures;Media;Software,,6.0,,18.0,IEEE,25 Jan 2018,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4

The model proposed in this paper considers that a biologically more plausible ANN has the purpose to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities, including learning processes, of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models upon which the proposed description is based takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and inter-neuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses.

Calling it a novel approach to evolutionary computing because, instead of working toward genetic computational approaches to biology, it studies complex adaptive systems in software as if software is the same among biological populations that abide by evolutionary theories of biology. This paper explores the relationship between complexity study as a scientific endeavor and systems thinking as a problem solving skill while approaching to generic software solutions, known as Computational Intelligence, to any problem of our interests at hand. The paper argues that skills in systems thinking are critical and applying them may add values to software development activities, especially to large-scale complex software aiming for the high quality and rapid productivity.

"6.8: Presentation session: Neuroanatomy, neuroregeneration, and modeling: “GPGPU implementation of a synaptically optimized, anatomically accurate spiking network simulator”",R. Scorcioni,"Neurosciences Institute, USA",2010 Biomedical Sciences and Engineering Conference,15 Jul 2010,2010,,,1,2,"Simulation of biological spiking networks is becoming more relevant in understanding neuronal processes. An increasing proportion of these simulations focuses on large scale modeling efforts. Unfortunately the size of large networks is often limited by both computational power and memory. Computational power constrains both the maximum number of differential equations and the maximum number of spikes that can be processed per unit time. Memory size limits the maximum number of neurons and synapses that can be simulated. To solve for the computational bottleneck, a neuronal simulator is implemented on a CUDA-based General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit (GPGPU). CUDA provides a C-like environment to harness the computational power of specialized video cards from NVIDIA (these cards provide a computational peak power on single precision floats of 1TFLOPS, at least an order of magnitude higher than the fastest CPU). To solve for the memory bottleneck, a just-in-time synapse storing algorithm is implemented requiring only 4 bytes per synapse. Only the synaptic weight is stored, while both post-synaptic contact and delay are recomputed at run-time. This allows a resource shift from memory to computation which fits with the peculiar GPGPU architecture, where an abundance of compute nodes access the memory via a bandwidth-limited bus. Neurons are represented by a single compartment whose activity is modeled by the Izhikevich formalism. Excitatory synapses are plastic and follow both a spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule and a short term potentiation/depression rule. We are able to simulate networks with up to a million neurons and up to 100 million synapses on a single GPGPU card. Networks of this size cannot be simulated on desktop computers. For smaller networks the speedup obtained is at least of an order of magnitude compared to traditional CPU platform. As an example of possible use of the present work we present preliminary results on the simulation of early stage of the visual pathway. In the retina, Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGC) project to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN). LGN projects to the cortical area V1. V1 projects back to LGN. The network is represented by 100,000 neurons, 10 million synapses, and 32 different morphological classes with >350 topological projections. Input to the network is provided by current injection in the RGC layer. The RGC layer models midget and parasol ganglion cells (representing 80% of the RGC in primates). Each ganglion type is then subdivided into on- and off-center cells for a total of 4 different types of RGC. Training is performed via natural stimuli while testing is done with vertical and horizontal bars. The network average spiking frequency is within biological limits. Testing performed with both vertical and horizontal bars shows each pattern propagating along the network's anatomical projections. At each stage the pattern is progressively elaborated and modified. In conclusion we present a novel simulator that is fast, synaptically optimized and anatomically accurate. At an additional cost to an available desktop PC of few hundred dollars we think the GPGPU is an ideal platform to simulate large spiking networks.",,978-1-4244-6714-3,10.1109/BSEC.2010.5510833,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510833,,Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Neurons;Biology computing;Computer networks;Central Processing Unit;Retina;Performance evaluation;Testing;Bars,,,,,IEEE,15 Jul 2010,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,4,4
