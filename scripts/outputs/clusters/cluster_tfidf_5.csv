Improving Computational Thinking Competencies in STEM Higher Education,N. Dehbozorgi; M. Roopaei,NA; NA,2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),17 Sep 2024,2024,,,1,4,"Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.",2473-7623,979-8-3503-5280-1,10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664997,Kennesaw State University; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664997,Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Integrated STEM Education;Student Performance,Surveys;Industries;Computational modeling;Focusing;Logic gates;Cognition;Pattern recognition,,1.0,,12.0,IEEE,17 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,8
A Guide Towards a Definition of Computational Thinking in K-12,R. Ismail; T. A. Steinbach; C. S.

To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.",2165-9567,978-1-6654-4434-7,10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766703,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766703,Computational Thinking (CT);K-12 Education;Dependency;Abstraction;Decomposition;Algorithmic Thinking,Computer science;Bibliographies;Conferences;Computational modeling;Engineering education,,,,69.0,IEEE,11 May 2022,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,6

Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342931,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342931,game-based learning (GBL);design-based research (DBR);computational thinking;computer science;undergraduate;constructivist;constructionist;analog,Surveys;Education;Digital simulation;Games;Solids;Reflection;Computer science education,,,,30.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,8

The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students’ understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students’ self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education.

Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems.

The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable.

While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children.

The main goal of the program is to prepare teachers to develop CT practices into early childhood learning environments by fostering several key components: recognizing the significance of CT development from early childhood, applying pedagogical practices (i.e. unplugged activities, Use-Modify-Create), identifying socially constructed roles and stereotypes surrounding toys, implications of screen and device usage in learning, and developing skills to design CT learning activities tailored for their own classroom settings. To achieve our goals, the research team designed, implemented, and evaluated an online 30-hour PL program with educators from Latin American countries. Approximately 80 teachers completed the online PL program. The participating teachers engaged with the PL program weekly by providing written journal reflections. In the final week, they were asked to design a lesson based on what they learned and implement it into their classroom. Teachers completed a pre- and post-survey surrounding their self-efficacy and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) in CT. Data sources include pre- and post-surveys, teacher journal reflections, and lesson plans developed by teachers. In this paper, we analyzed their journal reflections to qualitatively develop an understanding of how teachers progressed in the PL. The lesson plans will be analyzed to identify: (1) the learning goals for the students, (2) which activities teachers preferred to implement, and (3) how they assessed student learning in CT in their classroom. Preliminary findings demonstrate the types of CT activities they implemented in their classrooms. Teachers also created lessons that met their students' needs which further provides examples of how CT is integrated within the existing curriculum surrounding student interest and culture. Many PL programs often teach about CT concepts, but do not offer a chance to implement a lesson plan and reflect on their experience. This process helps teachers develop self-efficacy for teaching CT in an elementary classroom and teachers reported that they would continue to integrate CT within their future instruction.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections.

This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops.

The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies.

We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms.

A Systematic Approach to Catalogue Learning Resources that Promote Computational Thinking,C. Araújo; P. Rangel Henriques; J.

We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology.

Evaluating CT education programs presents challenges due to the limited research on the validity and reliability of data collection tools. In addition, evaluation of PD programs in CT often overlooks affective factors and fails to align with program outcomes beyond the training context, leading to insufficient evidence of their effectiveness. This study seeks to identify the factors that influence the effective implementation of CT teaching practices and contribute to the body of knowledge of professional development programs. Using a sequential mixed-methods approach, we first conducted pre-post surveys to assess changes in teachers' knowledge, followed by realist-based focus group discussions to gain deeper insights into participants' experiences and the factors influencing classroom implementation. The primary contribution of this paper is providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving changes in teachers' practices after participating in a CT-focused PD program in a middle-income country. Preliminary results indicate significant improvements in teachers' CT knowledge post-intervention. Qualitative findings highlight the importance of teachers' confidence in their CT knowledge and the need for comprehensive school support for effective CT integration.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-5150-7,10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893070,Ministry of Education; British Council; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10893070,Computational thinking;Professional development;Content knowledge;Mixed-Methods;Program evaluation,Training;Surveys;Data collection;Reliability,,,,24.0,IEEE,26 Feb 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,5,10

Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging.

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test.
