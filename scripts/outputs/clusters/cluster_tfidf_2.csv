Computational support for visual thinking in design ideation,R. Oxman,"Faculty of Architecture and T.P.Technion, Haifa, Israel",Proceedings. 1998 IEEE Conference on Information Visualization. An International Conference on Computer Visualization and Graphics (Cat. No.98TB100246),6 Aug 2002,1998,,,192,195,"A CDM (cognitive design medium) is defined as a medium which supports the cognitive nature of design in computerized environments. We review the theoretical background and demonstrate the basis upon which an interactive counterpart can be achieved in supporting the cognitive capabilities of the designer, such as visual thinking. The approach is elaborated and illustrated by experimental work in the area of conceptual design. We define three phenomena related to visual thinking in design which are characteristic of conceptual design: ideation, re-representation, and the evocation of generic representations. Finally, we demonstrate through examples how interactive computational environments can support these cognitive design phenomena.",1093-9547,0-8186-8509-3,10.1109/IV.1998.694219,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=694219,,Cognition;Psychology;Computer architecture;Couplings;Process design;Computational modeling;Buildings;Graphics,,,,8.0,IEEE,6 Aug 2002,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,2,4

Hu,"School of Media and Art Design, Wuhan Donghu University, Wuhan, China",2025 IEEE 14th International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies (CSNT),23 Apr 2025,2025,,,873,879,"The increasing development of weak artificial intelligence technology has had a profound impact on the field of design. It not only provides new sources of inspiration for artistic creation, but also makes the constraints of visual communication design more complex. At the same time, media convergence has promoted a strong demand for cross media conversion and diversified output, especially in the process of brand visual innovation, where more and more multimedia elements, dynamic effects, and interactive needs are emerging. Traditional visual design methods are insufficient in this complex design environment, and there is an urgent need to innovate design patterns through new technologies and strategies. Since the concept of ""computational design"" was proposed, algorithms and programming techniques have gradually become the core tools of modern visual design. Through extensive practice, computational design has not only brought rich changes to brand visual forms, but also developed into a systematic design pattern that can respond to the diversity and dynamism of today's design needs. This study explores the structure and development of computational visual design systems, with a focus on analyzing their potential applications and practical strategies in new retail pet brands. Through in-depth market research, the application opportunities of computational design in brand vision have been revealed, and algorithm based brand vision construction strategies, brand image communication strategies, and community driven visual communication strategies have been proposed.

"Perspectives on engineering design learning: Realities, challenges, and recommendations",W. Akili,"Principal, Geotechnical Engineering, Iowa, USA",2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),7 Dec 2015,2015,,,1,7,"Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success.
