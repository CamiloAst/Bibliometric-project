Computational thinking has become a form of literacy as it can help individuals to solve problems. Consequently, governments and bodies of accreditation worldwide have supported educational initiatives, primarily at the K-12 level. However, curricular changes are not enough. Teachers need to be prepared, so they develop the content knowledge associated with computational thinking concepts, practices, and applications in the classroom. To contribute to professional development opportunities geared toward the development of computational thinking pedagogical content knowledge, the Colombian National Academy of Exact, Physics, and Natural Sciences and the Global Center for Equitable Computer Science Education implemented an open online professional development program for Latin American early childhood and elementary educators. More than 100 teachers enrolled in a six-week online professional development program to integrate computational thinking activities from early childhood education. The program included two modules focused on conceptual understanding of computational thinking in early childhood and four more modules where the participants adapted, designed, implemented learning activities, and reflected on what happened during the implementation. As part of the participants' weekly interactions, the program included a Jamboard space, where the teachers answered a set of guiding questions, just like a discussion forum, but as a post-it wall, where they could access all their peers' contributions and questions in a single space.",2377-634X,979-8-3503-3642-9,10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343475,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343475,Computational thinking;conception;topic modeling,Analytical models;Discussion forums;Computational modeling;Government;Education;Accreditation;Computer science education,,,,13.0,IEEE,5 Jan 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,10

Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons.

Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science.

Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity?

Much of the literature in CS outreach research examines summer camps, after-school programs, and other school-year events that often have a focus on only teaching students computing content. Our program is unique and socially relevant as students are trained to assist teachers with the development of Computational Thinking-Infused curricula for their classrooms. This paper presents the design of our program, an overview of the curriculum, and results including both student and teacher feedback. Results show that the program has benefited each of the parties involved, including its student participants, facilitators, and the teachers assisted by the participants. We share our lessons learned in order to help other CS departments develop similar broadening participation in computing programs.",,978-1-7281-7172-2,10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272515,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272515,Professional Development;STEM+C;Computational Thinking,Fires;Education;Computational modeling;Programming profession;Games;Interviews;Handheld computers,,2.0,,12.0,IEEE,4 Dec 2020,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,10

Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.",,978-1-5090-1790-4,10.1109/FIE.2016.7757410,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757410,,Education;Programming profession;Computers;Computational modeling;Australia,,122.0,,102.0,IEEE,1 Dec 2016,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,9
Digital technology teachers' perceptions of computer science: It is not all about programming,E. Prieto-Rodriguez; R.

There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.",2377-634X,978-1-4799-3922-0,10.1109/FIE.2014.7044134,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044134,computational thinking;CS4HS;teacher perceptions,Conferences;Educational institutions;Computers;Mathematics;Programming,,12.0,,24.0,IEEE,19 Feb 2015,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,10

At this district, equity challenges have arisen as the city has grown rapidly over the past decade, shifting from a rural and predominantly White college town to a burgeoning tech sector with a significant influx of Latinx families. During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.",,978-1-6654-4905-2,10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620708,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620708,computing pathways;computational thinking;empathy interviews;inclusive computing,Computer science;Protocols;Instruments;Urban areas;Interviews,,,,9.0,IEEE,30 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,10
Delivering Virtual K-8 Computing Professional Development in Rural KY,P. Ruiz; E. Iwatani; Q. Burke; T.

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.",,978-1-6654-4905-2,10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620568,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620568,rural education;computing pathways;equitable access to computer science education;computational thinking;professional development;broadening participation in computing,Computer science;Handheld computers;Education;Global communication;Cultural differences;Videoconferences,,,,7.0,IEEE,30 Nov 2021,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,9,10

But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps.
